I don’t understand why the company is advertising ‘cinnamon’ flavor and there is absolutely none on the cookies. I’ve decided since you don’t care about the consumer, I’ll take my money to a company that cares and NEVER false advertise. Why lie? Why defraud your consumer?

" Jan. 6, 2022",MI,  6 people found this review helpful,"What the heck did I just buy? These are no longer worthy of a brand name. They should be packaged in a plain white box with black lettering that simply states ""cinnamon Graham Crackers"". The word cinnamon should not be capitalized and printed in the smallest font possible. Why you ask? Because there is hardly any cinnamon/sugar on them. This is NOT what I was expecting and I hope someone at Nabisco reads this. I wonder if you think you are fooling us or trying to get us to stop buying these. I am one that will NOT be buying this new formula. Think back to when New Coke was introduced. You should learn from others mistakes and stop being so stingy with your ingredients. Coca-Cola suffered from their mistake and I'm guessing you will also. Based on other reviews, I am not alone.",1

" Oct. 27, 2021",Ot,  7 people found this review helpful,"... We saw a change in the taste and texture of Graham crackers many years ago -- it has to be at least a decade now. Until that time, there was no other brand that came close -- Christie was the best. I stopped buying it back then because the new recipe was truly disgusting. I then tried other brands, but they were all bad. Well, I went to the store this morning and bought a box on a whim, hoping that they might have paid attention to the many, many complaints and returned to the previous recipe. They did not, and straight in the garbage went the box. Why ""fix"" it? It wasn't broken -- far from it. SMH.",1

I would rather spend my money with another brand or store for a more tasty cracker.  Maybe my small purchases don’t matter to a huge company like Nabisco but it’s not right what they’re doing to the consumer. But I’m sure they don’t care.

" May 7, 2020",CA,  49 people found this review helpful,"Since at least 2010 the good old Honey Grahams have gone through many changes that Nabisco will not admit, and the product now even smaller than the prior 3 changes, and taste even worse. They are real close to being able to call them ""BITE SIZE"" and able to fit them all in butter box. All of Nabisco products have gone through this change because we are stupid and can't notice, correct... No we can see it and I myself have stopped purchasing them. Soon they will sell them in Family size box and the same amount for more money. My hopes are they will do like coke and release the original recipe, original size, original box, so we can all go back to enjoying milk and grahams like old times.",1
" April 29, 2020",WI,  51 people found this review helpful,"When Nabisco first changed the Honey Maid Graham recipe that we all loved for many decades, both I and my adult daughters were furious with the dry, tasteless replacements. I vowed never to buy them again. But I'd seen other online complaints so secretly thought the backlash would be so bad that Nabisco would come to their senses. After all, the CocaCola company righted their wrong with great speed after foisting ""New Coke"" on us. So for my 65th birthday, I dared to try another box as I wanted that familiar yumminess dipped in milk to comfort me during coronavirus quarantine. But oh,YUCK! Nabisco is not so wise with consumers and are still marketing the dry, brittle and tasteless cardboard they're trying to pass off as our beloved honey graham crackers. All my years growing up, if anyone served another cheaper brand in their home or purchased non-Nabisco grahams for milk break in school, we were always horrified by the lower quality. But now Nabisco are still passing off these tasteless wood chips that seem stale right off the production line. Message to Nabisco: Stop screwing over the public with your ""healthier""?!? recipe garbage graham crackers, and make America great again by returning your production to the US. I would love my toddler granddaughter to be able to enjoy the original honey graham recipe as it was originally marketed. And I would love to experience it again before I die. (Which could be sooner than later if I keep eating the trash you are packaging now!)",1

Just the right amount of sweetness for me. But will not buy them ever again. Taste terrible. What happened? Does Nabisco really think the consumer has no taste buds? I remember my 83 year old mother complaining about the reduction in crackers but price still the same. At least then they were still good tasting. I’m going to now boycott Nabisco products. Feel ripped off.,1

Leave them to someone else. I am sick of it. This is not the first time this has happened. Soon we will be paying for just the thought of something we once loved.

A once distinguished respectable company at the Top of their game is now at the bottom. I will not buy any more Nabisco products unless they prove they fixed the manufacturing issues and quality control.

I had noticed that they broke more easily the last time I bought them, which was several years ago. But now they are noticeable thinner and basically useless for s’mores. I’m afraid there was nothing wholesome about the moment created by this pile of broken pieces I’m left with. Yes, I cursed. I wanted a s’more.",1

I am thinking they are hoping to do just that because the Honey Maid (by the way is supposed to be spelled Made) Graham Crackers are smaller, blander, and without the flavor they had in the 80s and 90s when I was a kid. What happened, do they make these with the wrong recipe? Even the Cinnamon Grahams don't even have cinnamon on them at all! What is it, a thin layer of warehouse dust? If you are looking at these reviews, Nabisco, whatever changed in the last 15, 20 years to your Graham Crackers was a serious business mistake. I would re-think what you did and not do it because your brand is suffering. I will not even use these for my pies anymore because something seems like it is missing from the cracker.",1

I noticed an earlier post that asserts Nabisco has decreased the amount of crackers such that they fit more loosely in the box and are prone to rattle around and break. I suspect this is the reason as I’ve also noticed I have to buy them more frequently. I’ll be looking for another brand in the future (or giving up s’mores).

Recently I have noticed the crackers are usually broken when a new box is opened. Then I realized Nabisco pulled a fast one. The box used to have 10 packs of crackers stacked in pairs 5 high to the top of the box and they fit snugly into the box. NOW they have decided to use deceptive packaging and have turned those packs on their sides which makes each stack of now FOUR taller to fill the box. By doing this the packs are loose in the box since the width of the packs is not anymore the same width as the box. This allows them to rattle around in shipping and they get damaged. NOT ONLY THAT, it's also a 20% INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT technically since now customers are receiving 20% fewer crackers in the box without lowering the price. This is called DECEPTIVE MARKETING in my mind. I will be looking for a competing brand now as my way of showing my resentment to this unfair practice. A couple years ago they did the same thing with OREOS by lowering the cookie count to a 13oz package from what was an 18 oz package. That was also a around a 25% increase in the price since 25% fewer cookies were being packaged for the same money. I NO LONGER PURCHASE OREOS.",1

I should have not tried them again once I found they were made in Mexico but saw one box said new on it like they had improved the product so last week at Wal-Mart my wife bought the big box without asking me and I thought well maybe they are new or better. Wrong. Did not think they could get any worse but they have. You would think the company would respond to us the customer if we had a problem. NOPE will not. So forget them getting any better. They are getting worse. Crackers thinner with no color and the taste yuck lost the Graham Cracker taste. Now just another cracker as if I bought a low quality cracker. I tell you what I quit buying other products from Nabisco but like a graham with coffee so gave them another chance but never again. Stay in Mexico and go broke. It serves you right as the quality and size has gone way downhill. If I owned another company making crackers I would take advantage of your mistakes and take over what was once your market. Folks we need to buy food products made in America not Mexico. I challenge you to find out who checks the quality of the product or checks the factories where they are produced. I could not.

I remember they used to be so rich and flavorful, you could bite into one and suck the richly aromatic, dill-laden olive oil into the back of your mouth. Heavenly! What others have reported is that their favorite Triscuit suddenly stopped tasting as rich and flavorful, and I agree. The change happened some time in the past few months. Now Triscuits seem dry, crumbly, very ""blah"" in flavor, and hardly worth eating after you got used to the originals.This is the same kind of marketing genius a lot of new cool restaurants go through: They start out with top-drawer recipes and superb quality, and then, after a couple years, they start gradually downgrading the experience, little by little, one seemingly benign change after another -- so nobody will notice, I suppose. Well, I always notice. When the place or product gets degraded past a certain point, I simply stop going there or purchasing the product.

" Feb. 16, 2017",TX,  39 people found this review helpful,"After reading the reviews and complaints on this site and other web sites with reviews of Nabisco products, I have come to the conclusion that Nabisco has duped us all. I have looked at a number of review site similar to ConsumerAffairs and have read the same type of negative reviews about Nabisco saltine crackers that I see on ConsumerAffairs' website. Any complaints directly to Nabisco regarding their now inedible Premium Saltine Crackers evidently have fallen on deaf ears.Interestingly enough, there is one website that has 163 reviews of the Nabisco Premium Saltine Cracker. Guess what, folks, 163 of those 163 reviews are 5-star. What? Really? What are the odds? I want to know where those people buy their Nabisco crackers? I want to shop at their stores because they obviously do not buy crackers at the stores where I do. I even looked at the website's header to be sure I was reading reviews for Nabisco. Wonder which 163 Nabisco employees wrote those 163 reviews? I see writing a Nabisco review on Influenster in my near future. What fun! Wonder if Influenster's administrator will actually post it?The last box of Nabisco ""Original"" Premium Saltine Crackers I bought had a date of 04Jan16. I assume it was manufactured on that date. I do not know when I bought it, but I have been hanging onto it hoping that someone would say ""send your Nabisco crackers here for testing"". I threw away all but a couple of the small packages. When I opened the box, I noticed the really awful smell. If you can manage to somehow get past the odor and bite into a cracker, the taste is even worse.Note, the Nabisco box still carries the claim ""Original Premium Saltine Crackers"". There is nothing ""original"" at all about the crackers Nabisco is producing now. Let's face it, saltine crackers, in and of themselves, do not have a huge taste presence. They have always been a little bland, but had a nice, toasty taste. The cracker has always been topped with salt you could see. In fact, there was so much salt that when you turned the sleeve of crackers upside down to dump them out, you had to hold the package over a bowl or salt would spill everywhere. When I was pregnant and had morning sickness, I must have eaten a jillion Nabisco saltine crackers. I have always loved to dip Nabisco crackers smeared with real butter into bowls of hot, tomato soup. Sooo yummy. Well, I can't do that anymore.I just do not know how any company could produce a bad tasting saltine cracker - but Nabisco has managed to do so! The crackers are very white and much thinner than what I had come to expect from Nabisco, and there is almost no salt on the top. Reminds me very much of a white, tasteless communion wafer, except Nabisco's cracker has an awful smell and tastes like what you might imagine insecticide would taste like.I do not know where the saltine crackers I bought were made. The plant code looks like ""BD"". I do not find a reference to those letters in any Nabisco plant code information on the internet. Nor, does the box designate that the crackers were made in any other country than the USA. But, that is a whole other issue. It appears that Nabisco, with a lot of nerve and a straight face, advertises to unsuspecting consumers that the Premium Saltine Crackers they offer for sale are the ""original"". Does Nabisco think the public is really so dumb that consumers will continue to buy and eat that crap? I guess they do.",1

Specifically their Graham crackers which were always high quality and taste. It was so obvious that they have changed that I took to this site to consider making a complaint and I was amazed how many similar complaints there are. Many of these complaints reference that they are now owned by Mondelez a Mexico based company, and apparently Nabisco has moved much of their production facilities to Mexico. While that is upsetting, it's too easy to use that as an excuse. I really hope that Mondelez cares about the quality of their products and monitors these type complaints because they should if they want to be continue the success Nabisco has had.Nabisco, like many companies made their name and reputation on producing high quality, great tasting products. People grew up eating their brands. Nabisco went through many buyouts and new owners over the years, but they maintained their reputation for quality and taste. They were never the cheapest, but you always knew you were getting quality. Then what happens? Mondelez somewhat quietly buys the company and gradually takes it from a US brand to a global brand under the Mondelez name. Then production begins shifting to Mexico a little at a time. Raw materials and quality are not the same, and the same standard of quality isn't established in Mexico like it is here.What we consider inferior, they would find acceptable because they didn't have a comparison. So one of two things is happening, either the execs at Mondelez think they are producing a great product of the highest quality because they don't know any better, OR they know they are making an inferior product now, but the global volume they are selling offsets the loss in US sales they are experiencing from those that are no longer happy with their product? And they are making more money, by using inferior raw materials and cheap labor. It's all about mass production on a global scale of low to average quality product and making a huge margin while they can. I have always been loyal to the brands I trust. I will no longer consider Nabisco one of those brands.",1

Wait, I take that back I can't describe the taste except maybe cardboard or worse. And don't get me going on the Ritz crackers. If they don't arrive with many broken ones in the sleeve they may break as you take them out of the sleeve and they will definitely crumble when you try to spread anything on them or dip them into any kind of mix. And the Oreos? Not only have they shrunken to about half their original size but the filling is less and is also tasteless. I'm sure the big shots at Nabisco are still getting their outrageous salaries and bonuses and I'm even surer that they don't care what the consumer thinks but are they ever wrong.One of my first courses in college was sales and marketing and I learned way back then that there are three things that companies need to do to sell their products. Pay close attention to PRICE, QUALITY, AND SERVICE. When you pay twice as much for something and get half as much product that's strike one. When you stiff the customer with food that's not fit to eat that's strike two. And the strikeout comes when you don't acknowledge that you already have two strikes. Wake up Nabisco but it may already be too late to save an icon. I understand that Keebler Elves make much better Crackers and cookies. Or I might even try the store brand. Gasp!",1

I will not buy another one of your products. Huge disappointment in what used to be a dependable company. You need to take your name off the boxes.

Ritz have been awful the past year or two - they crumble just by looking at them. I now have a large jar of Ritz crumbs to use for meatloaf and baked chicken. And the saltines are often stale because the sleeves are not sealed properly. As for the Fig Newtons, not only are the packages much smaller, but the recipe seems to be different - they taste much more grainy and woody - not as good. I've switched to the store brands, much better. This past year, I did complain about the products and was sent a coupon for one free Nabisco product - whoopeee. I'd much prefer that Nabisco goes back to the original quality of the food, and better quality control.",1

With regards to the Ritz Cracker product line, within the past year I have found that most of the crackers upon opening are broken at both ends of the roll as well as the center. When I take a single cracker out it breaks. Nothing like what is shown in TV commercials! What ingredient has been removed as a cost cutting measure that makes the crackers so brittle? It isn't shipping. Also, the adhesive that seals the seam from top to bottom is so bad that many of the boxes I open have this seal broken and the crackers are stale. The shelf life is also very short now. The amount of crackers per roll has dropped but the price has increased. I will now start buying the house brand of these snack crackers since Nabisco has lost my trust and business.",1

But I've noticed an extremely odd fact: each sleeve has a different number of crackers! I've counted between 36 and 43 crackers in the individual sleeves, with fairly even distribution across that range. Now, I haven't kept track to see if there is a standard total for each box as a whole, so I don't know if they routinely contain the same total number of crackers per box or not. It's just that with so much automation, in the manufacturing process, it's odd to find a deviation as large as a 7-cracker swing per sleeve. Anyone else noticed this?",4

The other reason I don't need a response from them is that they have decided to move production facilities to Mexico.

This odor is due to rancid oil. Most polyunsaturated oils (like soybean, as is used in these products) are very susceptible to oxidation. The byproducts are not particularly toxic, although the smell is sickening, I'll agree. I notified Mondolez through their website, and all I got was a voucher for $4.99 to buy another package.

" May 22, 2015",CA,  14 people found this review helpful,Like many others I also had an unpleasant experience with Nabisco Honey Grahams. I did email the company and got a call back. They claimed I was the first to complain about regular Honey Grahams that the previous complaints were about Low fat Honey Grahams. Said that the problem with the low fat was rancid oil. I also called FDA (you have to call your local reporting area cannot file a complaint on-line) and got a call back from them. They said that rancid oil was the problem with the low fat but that they were continuing to get complaints and were reopening their investigation. They would have liked to get my box of crackers but I had already returned them to Costco - IF YOU HAVE YOUR BOX CONTACT THE FDA THEY MAY WANT IT FOR THEIR INVESTIGATION. Anyway I am done with Nabisco after 60 years of eating them. I'm searching for another brand!,1

Finally asked the store manager(s) and was told that Nabisco ""doesn't make them anymore."" Odd since they are sold on Amazon. The apparent replacement Honey Maid grahams taste awful and smell terrible. I'm not sure if it was cost-cutting or an attempt to create a better nutritional product but the result is an utter taste failure. Lots of desserts involve a graham crust -- the new crackers have such a terrible taste that they ruined several cheesecakes and parfait desserts -- not even adding butter and sugar can hide how vile they are.",1

" Feb. 28, 2015",VA,  4 people found this review helpful,Purchased a box of Honey Maid Graham crackers recently (my current box expires March 3rd 2015). After opening one of the three packages I had a bite from a cracker and noticed a stale plastic/cardboard taste and thought maybe it was just because I hadn't had graham crackers in a while. I also sniffed the inside of the open package which confirmed the strange smell of old plastic or cardboard. After leaving them in the cabinets a few weeks I came across an article mentioning the terrible stinky taste of the graham crackers and couldn't believe others thought the same thing. I'm truly disappointed in the taste of the crackers and hope Nabisco gets to the bottom of the current production of crackers. I would be more than happy to provide my crackers as a sample of the stinky taste. Thank you for taking the time to review.,4

I could smell them before I even opened the package. They were emitting a chemical smell, even through the box. About a month ago I took all the boxes back to the store for exchange. Even my car smelled like chemicals just from leaving them in the car for a few hours!

We explained to him what the issue is with the Grahams and he did not seem to have any knowledge of a recall or previous problems with the product. We did get issued a gift card for the items but when we went to the shelves to get new Grahams, there were no low fat Grahams in sight!!!!!

After reading this I realized I too had a bad experience recently in January of this year 2015. I purchased them from a local grocery store and never before have I had any problems with this product through the years. My mother always bought them for us as children and I am now 56 years old. I had opened a package of them and noticed a very odd smell so I live with my older sister and wanted her to smell them in case my nose wasn't working properly since we both have had recent colds. She could not smell anything like I did.. So I figured I would go ahead and eat them. Well once I started eating them I realized they tasted as bad as they smell so immediately threw the box of them in the trash. Didn't bother with writing any info from the box or codes because I figured it wasn't worth the gas to take it back to the store I purchased it from. Nor did I contact the company because sometimes a bad item will get through and didn't want to be a complainer. I wish now I had because apparently there was something wrong with the product and several others have complained. Now I am unsure if I will buy this product again unless we find out the reason for it and how it got put on our shelves like this.,2

She left them on the counter - then without knowing, my husband reached in and tried one - he ran to spit it out as well. My son walked past and said these smell like chemicals, or paint or something off. Certainly not the normal smell of something one would consume - that's for sure. I just called the 800 number on the box, but the recording says to call back during normal business hours. I then decided to go to the Honeymaid website, and found someone had posted 'My honeygrams stink.' That's when I saw this link to Consumer Affairs that someone else had posted to the Honeymaid website. Please, please, make Honeymaid RECALL this item that is making people sick. It's not right. I don't know where to go with this information. Should I just throw the boxes away? Or should I save them to show someone else?

" Dec. 1, 2014",TX,  4 people found this review helpful,"A year ago I purchased a box of Triscuts at Winco in Twin Falls, ID. I bit into a cracker and immediately felt extreme discomfort in my mouth. It felt as though small bits of glass went into the roof of my mouth and around my upper gums. These were very, very small particles causing immediate ruptures. I went to a dentist, I suffer from chronic staph infections due to work injury/multiple surgeries/long term antibiotics. I cannot have antibiotics easily and at the time I was in Hailey ID. No dentist would see me except one and he would not do anything but could see the bumps. He would not attempt to touch them or remove anything without antibiotics as I have titanium in my right shoulder and it makes up for most of my right arm. I have continued to suffer with ruptures, ""string"" like thread that cuts my mouth up that has taken over my gums. This has been the most unusual but cannot be an isolated incident. I believe these are the results of a bobbin or plastics area gone bad in one of the plants supplying the wheat or where it is processed. It could not have been in only one cracker. My roommate threw out the box and it was trash day. He was not thinking it would be a serious issue. I have exhausted my Doctors, as I have no insurance to pay for an oral surgeon. They are the only ones who will spray a color spray to find the ""string"" that is along the gum line. It is very fine so that it gets lost in saliva. Too small for normal tweezers. I am not nuts or crazy. People can see the string stuck between my teeth at times. We cannot remove it. It at times has made me not want to go another day like this. Your customer service has never followed up with me, again, I do not believe I am the only person to which this sort of thing has happened. Please let me know what I can do to remedy this.

The newer style re-seal pull open top has been long overdue. But when it comes to the cookies themselves, I must take you to task for such a blatant mistake with it's content. There is the smallest amount of cream filling that I could ever imagine. Your next step would have be to sell the outer chocolate cookies without any filling.

In short, this brand can now count itself among the mediocre brands of crackers. What is my personal consumption? For the last 10 years: 1 - 2 boxes a week equals conservatively 60 per year 600 boxes in 10 years! My entire family considerably more.

I had actually noticed the last few boxes I had bought of regular Nabisco Saltines weren't as good as they used to be, but I thought it was probably just me. I've only bought the Nabisco crackers for years and years because no other saltine was as crispy or tasted as good to me. But I can't say that anymore. I was going to email the company to let them know how I felt but couldn't find their email address on the box, so I did a search online and came across this review website. I also tried calling them but got a busy signal. The box that I purchased did not say that they are made in Mexico, but it gives an address in NJ. It doesn't say they are made there, though, so maybe that is where they have their US offices. My husband recently bought a bag of generic oyster crackers from our small, local, discount store and they are amazing... very crispy and taste great! The price was so much less and I've also noticed that most, if not all, of the products (at least all the ones that I've checked) at these small discount stores are products that are MADE IN AMERICA!

First, NABISCO springs this new cracker on us & then to get us to still buy the crackers they straight LIE to us by saying that this new ""imposter cracker"" has the same great taste when it is FAR from the same taste or texture. There is NOTHING tasty about this ""new"" cracker. It is bland and you can't taste the sea salt on them anymore (which is a main reason we loved the previous version). The crackers in pack are free and loose, leaving them to rub against each other more often causing the salt to fall to the bottom of the pack and so they are ""naked"" by the time they get to your bowl.In a sleeve, they are more confined and stay in one place. Plus, it's just not the same as busting open the sleeve. At least they could have sleeved them (Ritz can do it). There's a saying that is SO true in this case..... ""If it isn't broken, don't try & fix it!!!"" This WAS a cracker that we loved in this home, but now it's just a cracker-less sad soup night. I refuse to buy any other brand of crackers, BUT we can't have cracker-less soup nights forever. We may just have to switch cracker companies..... That is if NABISCO doesn't fix their gigantic mistake of changing up the crackers. Nabisco should have never tried to be the ""cool"" company by creating a new exciting product they thought would boost sales!If they wanted a new look for some product, they should have done so with new ingredients and a totally new cracker. Instead, they mess with a perfectly good cracker & its just none sense! I can't even count the MANY conversations I have had about this cracker switch up with family members, friends & random people on the cracker isle at the grocery. Everyone's upset about it too, which in return is going to lower sales (or so I hope, so they will bring back our older style & taste cracker). NOT COOL NABISCO, not cool! I would have chosen 2 stars for just being dissatisfied, but like I said, I am angry about the cracker switch!!!!! ANGRY!!!!

In fact, most of the premium varieties were missing. I loved these whole grain crackers. They were strong enough not to crumble under spreads and dips, yet they were crisp and flavorful. And they had just the right amount of salt. Please bring back the square premium whole grain crackers.I recently found the new round crackers. I debated whether to buy a box but I did. First of all, the crackers are loosely bagged and not sleeved like Ritz. There are fewer crackers per box now. The taste and texture are not the same. Several crackers were broken and there was over a quarter cup of crumbs in the bottom of the bag. I will not be buying these crackers again.",1

I do not like them at all! I loved the ""square-top"" sea-salted crackers! Why did you opt to change them? That was a bad decision! These new ones crumble as soon as you put anything on them (tuna, cheese, crab salad, etc.) I hate that! The older versions were delicious! I used to often eat them plain without anything on them.

I really wish Nabisco or any other maker of saltines, would make a type of cracker that is completely salt-free, as I don't eat the cracker alone but enjoy adding foods like peanut butter or cheese, and sliced kielbasa to my saltines. They help spice up my saltines enough so that if they weren't flavored to begin with, it wouldn't matter as the little cracker sandwich becomes salty enough. By doing this, I can do a decent job of controlling my salt intake by watching what type of cheese or peanut butter I eat and so forth. Even crumbling unsalted crackers into somewhat salted soup would save me from having a diabetic reaction from those times when I do the same with saltines with unsalted tops (i.e. salted bottoms).

The crackers are less salted and in no way taste like the square crackers before you started to burn every other batch about two years ago. My guess is that you lacked in quality control with the square premiums before you went to round ones because you were laying off workers as part of the cost saving measures. So in the last couple of years, I have not been able to taste that original premium square cracker that I have been accustomed to my entire life. I am 50 years old.

The 1/2 packs (if you will) didn't look like a fair half pack so I counted them. 15 crackers per pack, multiply by 8 and you get 120 crackers. They also were much harder and lacked the usual goodness of the 4-pack box. I ran those out and went back to my usual 4-pack and did a cracker count. There were 38 crackers in a pack, multiply that by 4 and you get 152 crackers. A difference of 32 crackers for the same price! That's nearly the amount of one of the 4 pack sleeves. I might add that I also discovered the 8 packs had a much heavier weight of plastic for the sleeves, which apparently aided in the weight factor. Nabisco, if you thought you were pulling the wool over the general public's eyes, think again. I read every one of these reviews to which most are complaining about the nasty round crackers that I really have no interest in anyway, but it stands to reason that this small percentage of complaining customers is probably only a fraction of disappointed people as most of your customers may not post a complaint in the first place. I might also add that after returning to my usual 4-pack, they too lack in that wholesome goodness they once had. Very crumbly and the sea salt adds nothing to your saltines. You are literally screwing up a good thing. Give the people what they want and they'll be back.

I was confused and asked a clerk. She said they aren't available anymore. It's been my go-to food since I first crumbled them in my Campbell's tomato soup. Going to university, I found cafeteria food awful. What saved me? Saltines and peanut butter. When I was pregnant, they sustained me through morning sickness. At the cottage this humid July, the IBS struck. This means basically no food for at least 24 hours and then slowly introducing no fat, bland food. What works best? Saltines. I opened one of the Nabisco tins our family has used since we bought the cottage over 50 years ago. By a lake in the summer, the tins have kept the crackers from devolving into soggy muck. Thankfully, one tin had kept two sleeves of squares of last summer’s saltines crisp. Oh, how relieved I was! I hadn't dared go to the store. I might not make it. When I looked for the old square box, I found a smaller box of new round saltines. Disappointingly, the new ones have a different texture, less salt and won't keep for a year. Not only that, when I did finish the box, there was almost a third of a cup of crumbs. There weren't even enough whole crackers to consider buying these to serve to company. What did your test group have to say? Did you listen to them? Listen to the comments today. The new saltines are unacceptable! I like my wrapped sleeves of square saltines. The smaller amount in the new shape and consistency is not wanted. Look at the demographics for the people that have bought saltines. A good food product shrinking to maximize profit is unconscionable. Give us a break. Coca-Cola found out the hard way that North Americans want the real original.

If it was the CEO, check him into his/her personal physician to make sure he is still operating on all cylinders. I am a brand name shopper, regardless of price, if I like something, I will not cut corners to get it cheaper. Now I am using store brand saltine crackers and I tell everyone I come into contact with, to not buy the new saltines. Waste of money.Bottom line, you should be ashamed of yourselves. The American public is being manipulated and screwed over by almost every company out there these days. It's sad to find that you are jumping on that bandwagon as well.

Every other box of regular premium saltines I had purchased recently had been almost entirely without salt. I did not buy the low salt variety and so do not expect practically salt free saltines! I suspect they are seeing how many pennies they can save by regularly substituting low salt crackers for regular ones. Today, the recent change to round cracker packages adds insult to injury. Saltines is now cheating the public on cracker size yet charging the same amount as before. Clearly motivated by greed, Nabisco has taken a beloved product with a loyal and enduring customer base and run over both in their corporate disregard for anything but profit. As the rest of their fellow corporate 1 Percenters, the folks at Nabisco are clearly busy figuring out how best to gouge us for the most they can get, while giving us the very least possible product and quality.

I worked at the retail location and so I just told my manager and threw the cookies away.  After this happened several more times, my manager looked into it and said it was not an issue on our end.  I finally made a formal complaint on the Nabisco website and they sent me a coupon for a replacement, but said that it probably wasn't their fault because it seems like the store's warehouse may have caused the damage. These cookies have been cooked too long.  When I used the coupon at a completely different retailer, I encountered the same problem.  Now that I see others are coming across burnt products as well, I feel more confident that this is an issue on their end.  After reading the sickening stories of rat and bug parts in their crackers, I think I will no longer be purchasing Nabisco products.",1

Over the past six months the flavor has been off, and the crackers are all burnt.  I have thrown more out than I have eaten.  Nabisco recently changed the recipe to sea salt, and they are still burnt.",1
