Brief Info:




We are currently in our Beta Phase - testing the app via Android and trying very hard right now to get accepted into the IOS.




Think of apps like coinbase, robinhood, and trust wallet (trading app and an app to store assets)

this is the app similar to what we are envisioning.




This is our current build: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altbase&hl=en_US&gl=US




We aim to be a simple cryptocurrency mobile app wallet and exchange for new users in crypto without needing much technical knowledge on trading and investing in cryptocurrencies.




The main features that I really want to be highlighting in the app besides the (trading and storing assets) are the analytics and chart dashboard similar to this app:

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinmarketcap-crypto-tracker/id1282107098




Our Big Vision:

To serve 1 Million users and give those users the opportunity inside crypto. We want want to be able to say below:




We helped 1 Million people go from, 'I don't know how to invest in Crypto' to 'Crypto changed my entire financial life'




$1 Billion Valuation
Become one of the most used platforms in the Crypto industry.




----




We are looking to expand our Mobile App Development Team.




We are looking for a Full-Stack Mobile Developer for IOS/Android. Someone who can handle front end + back end work.




Essential Skills/Experience Required:

React Native
Node Js
Solidity and/or Web3
Crypto Knowledge
Published an App in the IOS store (must be able to send a link of the app)
Big Crazy ideas (if your brain works this way - this is bonus points)




Benefits of Working With Us:

- Long-term position

- Company equity and Token Equity (since we are also a crypto token)

- Great bonuses and paid vacations

- You'll be a part of a start-up that is building in rapidly growing ecosystem (crypto)

- Very driven/relaxed work environment (I believe in autonomy more than anything, as long as you can prove you can be autonomous and have big ideas for yourself + for the company/app, then this will not feel like a job at all)

- Paid trainings (I believe heavily in self-education - which is why I invest in paid trainings/courses for my entire team and myself)

- Culture (As serious as we are about building a billion dollar crypto app, we also have lots of fun doing it)

- You'll learn every bit of crypto




-----------------------




Background About This Entire Project (Our story)




I am the CEO and Founder. I initially started this project as a crypto token in early 2021 fully bootstrapped and a one man army. I started livestreaming while building the project every single day for about 3-4 months (it was brutal, fun and also i didn't know what i was doing - but the idea kept evolving as I kept building the ecosystem).




Having a strong background in marketing and sales - I was able to attract lots of people to the community and to buying the token - we went from a $500,000 valuation to $88M valuation at the height of the crypto market (All in a span of 2-3 months)




We then sold some tokens in order to keep funding the project which then developed into an app. The reason why transitioned into an app was because I didn't just want to be a 'hype'/'meme' crypto project but rather a utility for the new crypto user of tomorrow. Crypto is growing day by day and there is a huge problem when it comes Onboarding into the crypto industry (getting cash into crypto, maneuvering around markets, which investments to pick, etc. etc.) - This is where Altbase App comes in.




I used the funds from the tokens sold to hire an app development company (because I had no idea how to build an app but I decided to take that risk) - I pushed that company to build the app in less than 2 months. During that time, I marketed the app like crazy and continued to livestream. I hired team members onboard to help me grow the community and oversea some of the app development and marketing. Our members were excited leading up to the app launch.




App launch came and within 1-2 weeks we had a flood of 15K-20K users. We had daily users and retention was great - however I knew that working with a 3rd part app dev company was unsustainable long-term because (too expensive, and I wanted people who believe in the vision LONGTERM) - Nonetheless, this was enough for a proof of concept. This took place around summer of 2021.




September - October 2021: We realized that we had to switch over to hiring our own developers because we want to build something long-term and sustainable and have developers that share the vision for the app. So we scrapped the entire app and rebuilt it from scratch which took us 3 months to build the Beta version (which is what we have now):

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altbase&hl=en_US&gl=US




We have active users - but the app isn't where we want it to be and feel development could move a faster if the right technical product manager was set in place.




I believe what we're building here will fulfill a huge need in the crypto space as there is lots of room to grow for any platform that builds in this industry.




The goal is 1M users and to help all those users go from ""idk about crypto"" to ""Crypto is going to help me retire"" - which will eventually result in Altbase hitting a $1B valuation.




I know I typed out a fairly long story but I just wanted to get this vision out.




If you believe you're perfect for this role and believe in what we're doing please do not hesitate to reach out and apply.




I look forward to speaking with you.

Co-founder, CEO of Goodbill

Our mission is to build trust and confidence into every health care transaction.




People spend over $100 billion of their own dollars every year, often going into debt, for hospital goods and services they don’t trust or understand. We make hospital bills transparent, understandable, and affordable by identifying billing errors and inflated charges to help people pay less.




Our mission is as important as it is technically challenging. We are building a simple, elegant consumer product, and full stack engineers at Goodbill are core to achieving this mission.




About the role




You will:




- Write both frontend and backend code, on a daily basis. We work in Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Rails, SCSS, and Hotwire. Experience in these languages is amazing, but not required. All we care about is that you’re excited about the prospect of working with this stack.

- Not only stitch together the frontend with the backend, but you’ll also help build large-scale data ingestion pipelines. We’re cataloging the price for every good and service at every hospital with every health insurance plan in the country. It’s no simple feat, and it changes regularly.

- Maintain all the systems you build. We believe no engineer should support code they didn’t write or have the ability to change, and no engineer should force others to support their code. It’s up to us, as a team, to build and support production-quality code.




You are:




- Equally comfortable and proficient making products pixel-perfect as you are designing elegant software architectures. We believe in sweating the details, which means we have high expectations across all aspects of our work. We want to work with people who are dedicated to their craft at the highest level.

- Addicted to speed. Startups are a sprint and a marathon at the same time. We have a duty to patients to make every day count.

- Excited to join something on the ground floor. Our founders have been-there-done-that on the startup journey, and are back because there has never been a better time to build a breakthrough consumer product that achieves this mission. It won’t be easy, especially starting this early, but you are ready to dive in and do whatever it takes to make it a success.

DESCRIPTION

The Human-in-loop services team builds AWS services and applications that enable the use of human intelligence in Machine Learning.

Ideal candidates have extensive experience with agile methodologies of development, have a high team work mentality coupled with a strong bias for action yet always insisting on highest standards.

We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship.

On-site","About Us

We make software that anyone can mold and shape to take on every challenge — from taking personal notes to running large companies. We've been building together since 2016 and are trusted by customers including Nike, Airbnb, Slack, Samsung, and more. We're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people we reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.

About The Role

It's critical that Notion's website tells a clear story about the product and the value and transformation it makes possible for teams and companies. Given Notion's broad flexibility, it's also important that we tell a compelling story to specific audiences based on user persona, industry, geographic location, and more. Our website is the most important and versatile tool we have to personalize this experience for the millions of visitors it attracts every month, and route them to the right products and plans for them.

Success in this role looks like helping us build a dynamic, reliable, and instrumented website that captures people's attention, helps them truly understand the product's benefits, and increases conversion to paid plans. The role is on the marketing team and will partner closely with designers and developers who also sit on the team.

We’re at an exciting stage as a team where we’ve built out the foundational pieces of our marketing website. Our next focus is on refinement and taking the user experience to the next level. We’re looking for someone who cares deeply about quality and craft and wants to push the boundaries of what a modern marketing experience looks and feels like.

What You'll Achieve

Partner with design and product marketing to build out the website in a way that tells a strong story to more of our audiences - i.e. Notion for Engineers, Notion for Marketers.
Drive the full stack development of our site: front-end, website infrastructure, data engineering, API integrations, logging, and more.
Ensure the full site is accessible, reliable, performant, instrumented, and optimized to increase conversions across multiple geographies.
Partner closely with growth to improve the performance of every page.
Build product experiences on the website so that people can visualize and get a deep understanding how it operates and the benefits it provides.
Pioneer external satellite sites, special projects, and experiments.
Help evolve our modern, component-based marketing architecture. Our site is statically generated using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and an intuitive headless CMS.

Skills You'll Need To Bring

Proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (we use TypeScript) and engineering fundamentals like Git.
Experience working with a front-end framework such as React or Vue (we use React + Next.js).
Familiarity with structured data and headless CMS platforms like Contentful.
Motivation to maximize business impact, and the ability to role up one's sleeves and get scrappy to make it happen.
Rigorous attention to detail across the full stack – someone who wants to make sure our website is a perfect ambassador for our brand on the front-end and technically sound on the server-side.
A good understanding of accessibility and a willingness to advocate for it.
Passionate about getting creative, reasoning from first principles, and not just building things because other companies like us have in past. You love to reach for the fresh and bold.
A brand mindset that gets excitement and joy out of telling stories in new ways and trying new things that haven't been seen before on a SaaS website ✨
Energy around collaborating with artists, writers, other designers, as well as engineers.

Nice To Haves

An appreciation of design and understanding of what goes into crafting a great user experience.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

DataRobot,UI/UX Frontend Developer,"Columbus, OH","Job Description:

“EngProd is the new DevOps”. We are pioneering a unique approach to optimizing engineering operations. We combine the best thinking from disciplines such as DevOps and lean methodologies, with data and smart automation to solve some of the hardest challenges with scaling a software delivery organization.

If you like to solve hard problems in creative ways, enjoy optimizing workflows and crafting a great developer experience, then consider joining us in this mission.

Our core beliefs:


Right information to the right person at the right time. We apply this principle to almost every solution we design. Whether that’s a slack bot informing your team they are requested to review a pull request, or looking up test failures to detect whether it’s a known failure reason or a flaky test to inform the affected developer.
Workflows for humans and machines are symbiotic. In an increasingly technology-driven world, more of our work involves working with automation. This frees up humans to do what they uniquely do best, while letting machines automate the rest. For example, why should a developer have to babysit a pull request? They can delegate this task to a bot to merge and deliver their changes once tests pass and they receive code review approvals.

Responsibilities

As part of this role, you will have the opportunity to work with people across the company (engineers within R&D, leaders within different departments, engineers supporting business operations) and make highly visible and impactful changes to optimize our operations. You will spend time getting a deep understanding of different personas and their workflow challenges, then collaborate with them to design a better experience.

You will lead the design, development, and architecture for all front-end user interfaces that our users (developers) interact with. This includes Slack bots, Github App, a Single-page application (VueJS, deployed on AWS Lambda, with python/flask backend). You will have the ability to design and develop completely new solutions (Chrome browser plugin and other custom app extensions) that have amazing usability to bring our developers delight!

You will ensure UI and UX best practices are followed, code quality is high, code is covered with automated tests (unit and e2e), and design guidelines are documented so that future frontend developers can efficiently get up-to-speed as contributors.

We value people who are passionate about productivity, eager and willing to tackle any problem no matter how hard it may seem and thrive on working closely and collaboratively with developers.

Requirements


Javascript
Javascript framework such as VueJS, ReactJS, or AngularJS
Experience with Linux or Mac


Bonus


D3 or similar javascript charting library
Experience building interacting visualizations / visual analytics
Full stack experience
Python
Browser plugin development


Our Core Values:


Be You - We are co-contributors to our culture committed to diversity, inclusion, equity and a sense of belonging throughout our global community. We value each person as their authentic self and welcome honest and respectful dialogue as an avenue to greatness.
Dream Big - We don’t settle for the status quo. We always pursue the development of the next version of ourselves. We believe investment in the growth and resilience of our people is the foundation of building an iconic company.
Be Data-Driven - We believe data-driven decision making enables innovation and execution at velocity while ensuring repeatable success. We take on the toughest challenges as we transform the world with our platform and AI.
Better Together - We celebrate success and learn from failure as one team. We foster an aligned, collaboration-first workplace by building trust through transparency, integrity and accountability.

🪄 Technical Recruiter, Engineering @ ChowNow

Send InMail
Are you inspired by best-practices and love building new products? Does the thought of creating client-focused, small-business-oriented products inspire you to craft high-quality, well-tested, and resilient TypeScript? Is React your preferred environment to build complex and interactive User Interfaces? Are you looking to apply your knowledge to influence technical and product direction? If so, keep reading; this might be the product development environment you have been searching for.

As a Frontend Engineer III at ChowNow, you will interact with trusted colleagues to contribute code and help build our product platform for growth and sustainability. You will help us launch quality products and support new initiatives to continuously improve the experience of our users (both our restaurant clients and their patrons). You will be an active voice in helping us shape the product by engaging in thoughtful inquiry and critical reflection. We believe positive relationships give our team the ability to exceed expectations. You will collaborate, learn, teach, and experiment with new approaches to enhance and support the platform as we scale.

Our Product and Technology

ChowNow’s front end applications are built on React and TypeScript with Webpack as our bundler. We use SASS and CSS modules when styling our components, and Jest with React Testing Library to test the components and the data stores. Our build pipeline is automated using GitHub, Jenkins and Docker. Our APIs are powered by Python, Node.js , MySQL, and Redis supported by infrastructure-as-code environments on Amazon Web Services.

About The Position

ChowNow is building an ecosystem that helps local restaurants find new customers, consolidate their brand, and improve their operations. It’s time for us to expand the platform, strengthening the relationship between diners and the restaurants they love, and helping our clients grow their business even further. Our current product offering includes a marketplace-web app, an online ordering system, and plans to build additional apps in the near future.

You will join our growing product and engineering team where you will collaborate to solve complex problems with a “quality product first” approach. You will be involved from design to delivery of new features and measuring the success of the product. As a senior member of the team you will have a deep impact on our platform, influencing technology choices, supporting leadership in decision making, and enabling growth of your colleagues.

You will start by learning our business model and how it translates to software architecture and product features. Working with the team, you will take an active part in shaping our technology, bringing the understanding of challenges and opportunities of various implementation choices. On a day-to-day basis, you will contribute to our code base and review the code of other contributors, measure, report, and respond to product and technology-related metrics supporting business growth, and act as the owner of individual pieces of our web applications.

About The Team

ChowNow is unique among tech startups in the restaurant space. We power branded online ordering systems for independent restaurants across North America – via websites, Google, and through branded iOS and Android apps – and we do it all for a reasonable monthly fee regardless of order volume. We operate this way because of our belief in being fair, sustainable, and equitable with our restaurant partners. And the same goes for our workplace.

Diversity, teamwork, and mutual respect are among our core company values. And we pride ourselves on giving our teams plenty of opportunities to make their mark. To date we’ve created over 20,000 apps for our restaurant partners – something that’s never been done before in our category. And as we expand to new markets, further spreading the word about the ChowNow difference, those opportunities to create, build, and grow will only increase. If this sounds like the kind of workplace, and the kind of mission, that appeals to you, we’d love to talk.

Together we can preserve neighborhood flavor, one restaurant at a time.

Responsibilities

You need to be self motivated and self managing. You’ll most likely be given broadly defined goals that’ll require you to break them down into achievable steps and tasks. No one is going to sit around and assign you user stories.
You have to be able to unblock yourself technically if you get stuck OR be very communicative and navigate to the right people to help unblock you. If you’re scared to get on video calls this position probably isn’t for you.
You’ll basically be given access to the git repo and patted out the door to get the local environment up and running on your own. Again, this isn’t IBM. No one is going to hold your hand like a college CS freshman, this is the big leagues. Self independence and accountability is held in very high regard.
The pace and tempo that the team moves at is very fast and very fluid. If you work well in a very structured and vanilla environment then this project is not for you.
We have morning standups where you’re expected to communicate what you’re doing and what your goals are. If you’d rather not do this and just submit jira tickets while hiding in the back, then this project is not for you.
The team looks for suggestions and opinions on how to do things better. We expect you, being the rockstar that you are, to provide advice and suggestions based on your past experience. We are a flat team and everyone’s opinion matters.
Design and build complex and performant web applications using the latest web tooling and modern JavaScript frameworks, including React.js & Redux and Node.js
Write and maintain high-quality code that is well-tested, documented and monitored
Identify UI problems to ensure best solutions for translating design into code
Collaborate with remote, distributed team members, including Technical Architects, Product Managers, Designers and other Engineers, to ship large-scale projects for enterprise clients
Communicate clearly and reliably with team members and/or client stakeholders, who could be CIOs of major enterprise companies, to ensure deliverability along the project’s technical specifications
Take ownership of project success by providing strategic technical guidance and direction, as needed
Work on interesting and challenging problems in the NFT space

A team player

You know it takes a village.
We’re committed to your health and happiness (...which are synonymous, you know).

When deciding what benefits should look like at Real, we started by thinking long and hard about what employees need not only to work well, but to live well. Benefits impact how we act, rest, grieve, set boundaries, and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company, but a mentally well society. At Real, we want to offer our employees more than just ""permission"" to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session. We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.

Payout

Competitive salary, plus equity in an early-stage startup. Emphasis on “plus”—we won’t use equity to low-ball you.


Healthcare

100% company-funded health, vision, and dental insurance. That means no monthly premiums coming out of your paycheck.
HSA/FSA plans
Free One Medical membership
Free Real membership
$1800 annual mental wellness stipend you can put toward therapy, psychiatry, and other mental wellness services
Short- and long-term disability coverage
Life insurance


Retirement

401(k) — we don’t match yet, but you’ll thank us for the compound interest later.


Vacation

Unlimited PTO…that we actually encourage you to take, we promise.


Rest

Quarterly company-wide week off — because sometimes, unplugging is easiest when everyone else is offline, too.
Four-week paid sabbatical after five continuous years of work at Real.


Floating Holidays

Three floating holidays in addition to company-wide federal holidays so you can celebrate what’s important to you.


Grief Break

Real employees receive two weeks of paid time off in the event of losing a loved one. We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.


Parenthood

Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.


Autonomy

Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.
Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.
Autonomous work culture. We don’t have to see a green dot on Slack to trust that you’re doing your job.


Growth at Work

We invest in your career. Our company's growing quickly, and we'll give you the opportunity to do the same. You'll have access to a number of professional development opportunities so that you can keep up with the company's evolving needs and grow your career along the way.


The responsibilities and duties of this position described here are representative of those an employee must perform. This is not a comprehensive list and other duties may be assigned.

We are an Equal Employment Opportunity (""EEO"") Employer. It has been and will continue to be a fundamental policy of Real not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, gender, gender identity, pregnancy, marital status, partnership status, domestic violence victim status, sexual orientation, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, veteran or military status, disability, medical condition, genetic information, caregiver status, unemployment status or any other characteristic prohibited by federal, state and/or local laws. This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including hiring, promotion, demotion, compensation, training, working conditions, transfer, job assignments, benefits, layoff, and termination."

Today, the “best” option for a patient diagnosed with an incurable disease is a prescription that, at most, temporarily improves symptoms. In the face of this stark prognosis, an alternative treatment option provides an avenue for hope: clinical trials.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

r2c,Senior Data Scientist,"San Francisco Bay Area
Remote","About R2c

Our mission is to make world-class software security available to everyone. This means building program analysis tools that are open source, easy to use, powerful, and fast. It also means building a team with security expertise and a passion for great developer experiences. Most of all, it means working with honesty and respect in a diverse community of dreamers and builders. We’ve redefined static analysis tooling by committing to all of these, and turned our project, Semgrep, into an essential safeguard for code at Snowflake, Dropbox, and more.

About The Role

You will be the founding scientist for r2c’s data team. Your mission will be to define how an entire company uses data, always striving to best improve our users’ security. You will work on a diverse set of problems, touching every aspect of the startup: extracting product insights from usage metrics, determining business strategy from market data, crafting production data pipelines, and defining where to direct our security research. This is a growth role: while you will start as an individual contributor, you will help grow this team, either by stepping into a management role yourself, or helping us recruit the awesome data-science lead you’ve always wanted.

Along the way, you will work with a dedicated group of full-stack, backend, and infrastructure engineers, as well as security researchers and program-analysis developers. You will learn what it means to have “secure-by-default” code. You will meet and collaborate with security-industry scions. And, as a member of our team, you’ll be a part of the decisions that make a high-growth startup successful. Your work will be critical to our mission. Every feature you build will have a measurable impact on our users’ lives. We’re excited to see what you do.

What You'll Do

Lead data science at r2c; discovering each department’s most pressing data problems, and proactively identifying the most critical areas to focus your efforts
Bring your wide knowledge of data-science approaches to each problem you solve: the first day you might apply multivariate regression to identify important product features, the second you might apply active-learning techniques to guide data collection and labeling, and the third you might work on an AI algorithm to improve security quality for our users
Iteratively tackle problems as a series of experiments, proving the value of your work with proof-of-concept to ever more refined results
Convince your peers of your conclusions with clear data visualizations and well-reasoned explanation
Help grow your team through the recruitment and hiring of top data talent


You are ideal for this role if you have

4+ years of experience in data and strategy fields
Knowledge of data-science approaches; this may include machine-learning algorithms, optimization methods or symbolic artificial-intelligence, but should also include statistical methods and “good-enough” heuristics — and the taste to know when to use each
Experience clearly visualizing information and experimental results
Sufficient familiarity with production data-processing pipelines to construct them working together with generalist infrastructure engineers; tools we use include EMR, Snowflake, S3, and Elasticsearch
Aptitude delivering technical projects via rapid iterative development
Excellent, proactive communication, both verbal and written


Some example projects that you might work on include

Build a statistical model that analyzes pseudonymous usage data to recommend the next features built into the Semgrep open-source tool
Consume infrastructure observation metrics to identify and address potential Semgrep.dev registry outages before they occur
Recruit varied and disjoint data into a “North Star” metric for the performance of the Semgrep open-source tool over time
Craft a security-rule-recommendation decision tree, using codebase features like languages, frameworks, code sentiment, and commit-message sentiment, to deliver targeted, high-value static-analysis rules to users


What We Offer

Our goal is to competitively and fairly compensate every r2cer with a system that equally rewards those who are vocal and those who are less comfortable making demands during the final steps of the hiring process. To that end, we generate internal compensation bands that are used when discussing and negotiating salaries. We update these based on market data to make sure they’re above the average for comparable roles.

We also invest in our employees’ well-being and long term success with comprehensive health plans, generous vacation time, 401k matching, learning stipends, and more. Our benefits are for everyone, so that you’re taken care of, and we work with individuals to make sure they have what they need, whether that’s quiet work space, adjusted hours, or any other accommodation.

Who We Are

We have people from France and the Philippines, physics and philosophy, formal methods research and full fledged corporations. We’re new parents and new grads, aspiring authors and aspiring Americans, dog lovers and dogfooders. We get together often to bike, bake, and meet up in parks. In our interactions, we believe respect and honesty go hand in hand, and prioritize both.

r2c is an equal-opportunity employer seeking a diverse range of backgrounds. We value who you are — including your cultural heritage, your socioeconomic status, your age, your race, your gender, your sexual orientation, your disabilities. We value what’s vitally important to you — your family, your religion, your politics. We value what you love in this world — your music, your weekend pursuits. We believe in welcoming varied professional backgrounds, educations, and interests. If you’re exceptional in your role, believe in r2c’s mission, and treat r2c’s values as your own, you belong here.

You will need working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English. We work as a hybrid on-site / remote organization. r2c primarily works in the Pacific, Eastern, and Central EU time zones."

Overview




The Data Science Team provides advanced analytical support across VNSNY’s family of corporations. We leverage big data to develop insights and to support strategic decisions for the agency. Meaningful, appropriate use of data is central to the success of our organization. We are looking for an ambitious data scientist to join our team.




About the Role




The Senior Data Scientist will join a core group of data scientists who play an important role in generating strategic insights across the VNSNY organization in these four applications of data science:




Clinical - “Who is going to get sick? What can we do to prevent or mitigate these health events? When is the best time to implement these actions?” This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes..
Quality – “How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members?” Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational – “How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members?” This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy – “What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care?” Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.




You Are:




Looking for an opportunity to perform hands-on data analysis and modeling to solve a wide variety of business problems while working alongside clinical/business stakeholders
Driven by curiosity and a passion to learn, you thrive in situations where you can bring clarity to ambiguous and multi-faceted problems
A logical thinker who is comfortable learning new programming languages and computing applications independently
Obsessive about streamlining data and modeling processes; if you find you or your colleagues doing something several times, you create a standard reproducible workflow
Love the challenge of exploring new data sources while practicing a healthy skepticism about data; when you find data that looks wrong, you are emotionally compelled to figure out why

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Nike, Airbnb, Slack, Samsung and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.




About The Role

Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.




What You'll Achieve

You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You’ll explore Notion’s data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)




Skills You'll Need To Bring

You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.




Nice To Haves

You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.




Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.

We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best and give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart! Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward."

Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at FaunaBio

Founded in 2018, Fauna Bio is an emerging biotechnology company pioneering a novel approach to drug discovery by unlocking the secrets of animal genomics to improve human health. Fauna Bio has raised more than 12MM in seed financing and is focused on identifying genes in animals that are responsible for disease protection and that have strong connections to related human genes. The company leverages insights from extraordinary mammalian traits to develop novel therapeutics that can treat and prevent diseases in humans. Fauna Bio is particularly inspired by the extraordinary physiology of hibernation. Hibernating mammals have evolved to develop mechanisms of self-healing and tissue repair that have implications for human health problems such as heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and muscle loss. This makes them an excellent model system for identifying drug targets because they can transiently protect themselves from problems similar to critically important human diseases, allowing Fauna Bio to identify key protective genes that are turned on or off at medically-relevant times. These insights also translate well to human biology, as hibernating rodents share 92% of genes with humans.




In addition to creating therapeutics to treat human diseases, Fauna Bio is also pursuing gene targets to induce hibernation for long-range space travel. While the program is still in an early stage, our goal is to allow humans to hibernate safely through long journeys.







Opportunity




A key part of Fauna Bio’s strategy is to have a world-class set of rich ‘omics data from emerging model organisms that represent novel therapeutic strategies for multiple diseases with high unmet need. We have built several methods for identifying drug targets including gene network analysis, scoring-based ranking, and a knowledge graph to link diverse data sources. The data integrated in these approaches includes Fauna’s proprietary hibernation data, decades of physiologic studies on hibernators, animal models of disease, and numerous public repositories of human and animal data.




This position will play a critical role in our discovery stage programs by building and maintaining these data resources.




Key Responsibilities:




ETL pipeline management of diverse biological data, with endpoints of both long-term storage (AWS S3) and further computational analysis from SQL/noSQL databases
Optimize storage of Fauna’s genomic and transcriptomic data on AWS S3
Development of effective data validation/verification processes in collaboration with the scientific team







We’d love to hear from you if you:

Have a master’s degree in computational field, data management, OR a bachelor’s degree in one of the above areas with 3+ years of relevant work experience. A minimum of 2 years working with multimodal data repositories is preferred.
Have working knowledge of Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Are proficient in a scripting language such as Python or R.
Are proficient in relevant libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and data.table etc.
Have a good understanding and hands-on experience with databases, specifically PostgreSQL and MongoDB
Have familiarity with genomic data and standard file formats
Are highly organized and have great attention to detail

Block,"Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Modeler, Risk","Denver, CO
Remote","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

As a Machine Learning Engineer within the Risk Machine Learning team, you work on projects that enable a software-driven, machine learning-centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.

Our algorithms derive value from our unique and rich data from our entire product portfolio within our rapidly growing seller ecosystem. We partner with business, product, operations and engineering teams to drive optimal decision making systems using sophisticated modeling and machine learning. We’re a passionate team of entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers who are shipping machine learning software that actively actively manages Square’s view on each transaction as it pertains to our revenue growth and risk.

You Will

Build machine learning/deep learning models that detect risk (credit or fraud) activity in real-time across our Seller’s ecosystem consisting of payments, banking and debit card products.
You will leverage experimentation mindset along with state-of-the-art algorithms to drive down false positives, collaborate on new product features to drive losses down and explore new datasets (including 3rd party data) to engineer new features for risk models.
Collaborate with business leaders, subject matter experts, and decision makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models

Qualifications

You Have

An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics or a related technical field.
PhD plus 4 years (or Master plus 6 years) industry working experience on applied Machine learning or Deep learning
A strong track record of performing machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, etc.) and SQL/NoSQL interaction patterns.
Expert level knowledge of modern techniques in machine learning and deep learning, e.g., transformer network architectures, with an orientation to maximizing such algorithms in a large scale production setting. Reinforcement learning experience is a plus for developing optimal control policies
Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation.
Machine learning strategic sequencing of methodological and software improvements to work back from maximizing core metrics associated with optimizing the business.
The ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences and stakeholders (PMs, Operations, Engineers).

About Vida

What are we trying to solve?

We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now.

Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered.

Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs, etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change.

At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone.

Why are we solving this problem?

The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change.

Who are we?

We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns.

Other things that we care about:

Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously.
We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village.
We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner.
We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other"

Block,"Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Modeler, Risk","Detroit, MI
Remote","Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

As a Machine Learning Engineer within the Risk Machine Learning team, you work on projects that enable a software-driven, machine learning-centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.

Our algorithms derive value from our unique and rich data from our entire product portfolio within our rapidly growing seller ecosystem. We partner with business, product, operations and engineering teams to drive optimal decision making systems using sophisticated modeling and machine learning. We’re a passionate team of entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers who are shipping machine learning software that actively actively manages Square’s view on each transaction as it pertains to our revenue growth and risk.

You Will

Build machine learning/deep learning models that detect risk (credit or fraud) activity in real-time across our Seller’s ecosystem consisting of payments, banking and debit card products. 
You will leverage experimentation mindset along with state-of-the-art algorithms to drive down false positives, collaborate on new product features to drive losses down and explore new datasets (including 3rd party data) to engineer new features for risk models. 
Collaborate with business leaders, subject matter experts, and decision makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models

You Have

An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics or a related technical field.
PhD plus 4 years (or Master plus 6 years) industry working experience on applied Machine learning or Deep learning 
A strong track record of performing machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, etc.) and SQL/NoSQL interaction patterns.
Expert level knowledge of modern techniques in machine learning and deep learning, e.g., transformer network architectures, with an orientation to maximizing such algorithms in a large scale production setting. Reinforcement learning experience is a plus for developing optimal control policies
Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation.
Machine learning strategic sequencing of methodological and software improvements to work back from maximizing core metrics associated with optimizing the business.
The ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences and stakeholders (PMs, Operations, Engineers).

We’re working to build a more inclusive economy where our customers have equal access to opportunity, and we strive to live by these same values in building our workplace. Block is a proud equal opportunity employer.

Linda Goodman

Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at FaunaBio

Send InMail

Founded in 2018, Fauna Bio is an emerging biotechnology company pioneering a novel approach to drug discovery by unlocking the secrets of animal genomics to improve human health. Fauna Bio has raised more than 12MM in seed financing and is focused on identifying genes in animals that are responsible for disease protection and that have strong connections to related human genes. The company leverages insights from extraordinary mammalian traits to develop novel therapeutics that can treat and prevent diseases in humans. Fauna Bio is particularly inspired by the extraordinary physiology of hibernation. Hibernating mammals have evolved to develop mechanisms of self-healing and tissue repair that have implications for human health problems such as heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and muscle loss. This makes them an excellent model system for identifying drug targets because they can transiently protect themselves from problems similar to critically important human diseases, allowing Fauna Bio to identify key protective genes that are turned on or off at medically-relevant times. These insights also translate well to human biology, as hibernating rodents share 92% of genes with humans.




In addition to creating therapeutics to treat human diseases, Fauna Bio is also pursuing gene targets to induce hibernation for long-range space travel. While the program is still in an early stage, our goal is to allow humans to hibernate safely through long journeys.







Opportunity




A key part of Fauna Bio’s strategy is to have a world-class set of rich ‘omics data from emerging model organisms that represent novel therapeutic strategies for multiple diseases with high unmet need. We have built several methods for identifying drug targets including gene network analysis, scoring-based ranking, and a knowledge graph to link diverse data sources. The data integrated in these approaches includes Fauna’s proprietary hibernation data, decades of physiologic studies on hibernators, animal models of disease, and numerous public repositories of human and animal data.




This position will play a critical role in our discovery stage programs by building and maintaining these data resources.




Key Responsibilities:




ETL pipeline management of diverse biological data, with endpoints of both long-term storage (AWS S3) and further computational analysis from SQL/noSQL databases
Optimize storage of Fauna’s genomic and transcriptomic data on AWS S3
Development of effective data validation/verification processes in collaboration with the scientific team







We’d love to hear from you if you:

Have a master’s degree in computational field, data management, OR a bachelor’s degree in one of the above areas with 3+ years of relevant work experience. A minimum of 2 years working with multimodal data repositories is preferred.
Have working knowledge of Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Are proficient in a scripting language such as Python or R.
Are proficient in relevant libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and data.table etc.
Have a good understanding and hands-on experience with databases, specifically PostgreSQL and MongoDB
Have familiarity with genomic data and standard file formats
Are highly organized and have great attention to detail
