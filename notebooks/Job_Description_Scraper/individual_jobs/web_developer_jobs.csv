Brief Info:




We are currently in our Beta Phase - testing the app via Android and trying very hard right now to get accepted into the IOS.




Think of apps like coinbase, robinhood, and trust wallet (trading app and an app to store assets)

this is the app similar to what we are envisioning.




This is our current build: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altbase&hl=en_US&gl=US




We aim to be a simple cryptocurrency mobile app wallet and exchange for new users in crypto without needing much technical knowledge on trading and investing in cryptocurrencies.




The main features that I really want to be highlighting in the app besides the (trading and storing assets) are the analytics and chart dashboard similar to this app:

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinmarketcap-crypto-tracker/id1282107098




Our Big Vision:

To serve 1 Million users and give those users the opportunity inside crypto. We want want to be able to say below:




We helped 1 Million people go from, 'I don't know how to invest in Crypto' to 'Crypto changed my entire financial life'




$1 Billion Valuation
Become one of the most used platforms in the Crypto industry.




----




We are looking to expand our Mobile App Development Team.




We are looking for a Full-Stack Mobile Developer for IOS/Android. Someone who can handle front end + back end work.




Essential Skills/Experience Required:

React Native
Node Js
Solidity and/or Web3
Crypto Knowledge
Published an App in the IOS store (must be able to send a link of the app)
Big Crazy ideas (if your brain works this way - this is bonus points)




Benefits of Working With Us:

- Long-term position

- Company equity and Token Equity (since we are also a crypto token)

- Great bonuses and paid vacations

- You'll be a part of a start-up that is building in rapidly growing ecosystem (crypto)

- Very driven/relaxed work environment (I believe in autonomy more than anything, as long as you can prove you can be autonomous and have big ideas for yourself + for the company/app, then this will not feel like a job at all)

- Paid trainings (I believe heavily in self-education - which is why I invest in paid trainings/courses for my entire team and myself)

- Culture (As serious as we are about building a billion dollar crypto app, we also have lots of fun doing it)

- You'll learn every bit of crypto




-----------------------




Background About This Entire Project (Our story)




I am the CEO and Founder. I initially started this project as a crypto token in early 2021 fully bootstrapped and a one man army. I started livestreaming while building the project every single day for about 3-4 months (it was brutal, fun and also i didn't know what i was doing - but the idea kept evolving as I kept building the ecosystem).




Having a strong background in marketing and sales - I was able to attract lots of people to the community and to buying the token - we went from a $500,000 valuation to $88M valuation at the height of the crypto market (All in a span of 2-3 months)




We then sold some tokens in order to keep funding the project which then developed into an app. The reason why transitioned into an app was because I didn't just want to be a 'hype'/'meme' crypto project but rather a utility for the new crypto user of tomorrow. Crypto is growing day by day and there is a huge problem when it comes Onboarding into the crypto industry (getting cash into crypto, maneuvering around markets, which investments to pick, etc. etc.) - This is where Altbase App comes in.




I used the funds from the tokens sold to hire an app development company (because I had no idea how to build an app but I decided to take that risk) - I pushed that company to build the app in less than 2 months. During that time, I marketed the app like crazy and continued to livestream. I hired team members onboard to help me grow the community and oversea some of the app development and marketing. Our members were excited leading up to the app launch.




App launch came and within 1-2 weeks we had a flood of 15K-20K users. We had daily users and retention was great - however I knew that working with a 3rd part app dev company was unsustainable long-term because (too expensive, and I wanted people who believe in the vision LONGTERM) - Nonetheless, this was enough for a proof of concept. This took place around summer of 2021.




September - October 2021: We realized that we had to switch over to hiring our own developers because we want to build something long-term and sustainable and have developers that share the vision for the app. So we scrapped the entire app and rebuilt it from scratch which took us 3 months to build the Beta version (which is what we have now):

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altbase&hl=en_US&gl=US




We have active users - but the app isn't where we want it to be and feel development could move a faster if the right technical product manager was set in place.




I believe what we're building here will fulfill a huge need in the crypto space as there is lots of room to grow for any platform that builds in this industry.




The goal is 1M users and to help all those users go from ""idk about crypto"" to ""Crypto is going to help me retire"" - which will eventually result in Altbase hitting a $1B valuation.




I know I typed out a fairly long story but I just wanted to get this vision out.




If you believe you're perfect for this role and believe in what we're doing please do not hesitate to reach out and apply.




I look forward to speaking with you.

Co-founder, CEO of Goodbill

Our mission is to build trust and confidence into every health care transaction.




People spend over $100 billion of their own dollars every year, often going into debt, for hospital goods and services they don’t trust or understand. We make hospital bills transparent, understandable, and affordable by identifying billing errors and inflated charges to help people pay less.




Our mission is as important as it is technically challenging. We are building a simple, elegant consumer product, and full stack engineers at Goodbill are core to achieving this mission.




About the role




You will:




- Write both frontend and backend code, on a daily basis. We work in Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Rails, SCSS, and Hotwire. Experience in these languages is amazing, but not required. All we care about is that you’re excited about the prospect of working with this stack.

- Not only stitch together the frontend with the backend, but you’ll also help build large-scale data ingestion pipelines. We’re cataloging the price for every good and service at every hospital with every health insurance plan in the country. It’s no simple feat, and it changes regularly.

- Maintain all the systems you build. We believe no engineer should support code they didn’t write or have the ability to change, and no engineer should force others to support their code. It’s up to us, as a team, to build and support production-quality code.




You are:




- Equally comfortable and proficient making products pixel-perfect as you are designing elegant software architectures. We believe in sweating the details, which means we have high expectations across all aspects of our work. We want to work with people who are dedicated to their craft at the highest level.

- Addicted to speed. Startups are a sprint and a marathon at the same time. We have a duty to patients to make every day count.

- Excited to join something on the ground floor. Our founders have been-there-done-that on the startup journey, and are back because there has never been a better time to build a breakthrough consumer product that achieves this mission. It won’t be easy, especially starting this early, but you are ready to dive in and do whatever it takes to make it a success.

DESCRIPTION

The Human-in-loop services team builds AWS services and applications that enable the use of human intelligence in Machine Learning.

Ideal candidates have extensive experience with agile methodologies of development, have a high team work mentality coupled with a strong bias for action yet always insisting on highest standards.

We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship.
