On-site","About Us

We make software that anyone can mold and shape to take on every challenge — from taking personal notes to running large companies. We've been building together since 2016 and are trusted by customers including Nike, Airbnb, Slack, Samsung, and more. We're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people we reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.

About The Role

It's critical that Notion's website tells a clear story about the product and the value and transformation it makes possible for teams and companies. Given Notion's broad flexibility, it's also important that we tell a compelling story to specific audiences based on user persona, industry, geographic location, and more. Our website is the most important and versatile tool we have to personalize this experience for the millions of visitors it attracts every month, and route them to the right products and plans for them.

Success in this role looks like helping us build a dynamic, reliable, and instrumented website that captures people's attention, helps them truly understand the product's benefits, and increases conversion to paid plans. The role is on the marketing team and will partner closely with designers and developers who also sit on the team.

We’re at an exciting stage as a team where we’ve built out the foundational pieces of our marketing website. Our next focus is on refinement and taking the user experience to the next level. We’re looking for someone who cares deeply about quality and craft and wants to push the boundaries of what a modern marketing experience looks and feels like.

What You'll Achieve

Partner with design and product marketing to build out the website in a way that tells a strong story to more of our audiences - i.e. Notion for Engineers, Notion for Marketers.
Drive the full stack development of our site: front-end, website infrastructure, data engineering, API integrations, logging, and more.
Ensure the full site is accessible, reliable, performant, instrumented, and optimized to increase conversions across multiple geographies.
Partner closely with growth to improve the performance of every page.
Build product experiences on the website so that people can visualize and get a deep understanding how it operates and the benefits it provides.
Pioneer external satellite sites, special projects, and experiments.
Help evolve our modern, component-based marketing architecture. Our site is statically generated using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and an intuitive headless CMS.

Skills You'll Need To Bring

Proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (we use TypeScript) and engineering fundamentals like Git.
Experience working with a front-end framework such as React or Vue (we use React + Next.js).
Familiarity with structured data and headless CMS platforms like Contentful.
Motivation to maximize business impact, and the ability to role up one's sleeves and get scrappy to make it happen.
Rigorous attention to detail across the full stack – someone who wants to make sure our website is a perfect ambassador for our brand on the front-end and technically sound on the server-side.
A good understanding of accessibility and a willingness to advocate for it.
Passionate about getting creative, reasoning from first principles, and not just building things because other companies like us have in past. You love to reach for the fresh and bold.
A brand mindset that gets excitement and joy out of telling stories in new ways and trying new things that haven't been seen before on a SaaS website ✨
Energy around collaborating with artists, writers, other designers, as well as engineers.

Nice To Haves

An appreciation of design and understanding of what goes into crafting a great user experience.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.

DataRobot,UI/UX Frontend Developer,"Columbus, OH","Job Description:

“EngProd is the new DevOps”. We are pioneering a unique approach to optimizing engineering operations. We combine the best thinking from disciplines such as DevOps and lean methodologies, with data and smart automation to solve some of the hardest challenges with scaling a software delivery organization.

If you like to solve hard problems in creative ways, enjoy optimizing workflows and crafting a great developer experience, then consider joining us in this mission.

Our core beliefs:


Right information to the right person at the right time. We apply this principle to almost every solution we design. Whether that’s a slack bot informing your team they are requested to review a pull request, or looking up test failures to detect whether it’s a known failure reason or a flaky test to inform the affected developer.
Workflows for humans and machines are symbiotic. In an increasingly technology-driven world, more of our work involves working with automation. This frees up humans to do what they uniquely do best, while letting machines automate the rest. For example, why should a developer have to babysit a pull request? They can delegate this task to a bot to merge and deliver their changes once tests pass and they receive code review approvals.

🪄 Technical Recruiter, Engineering @ ChowNow

Send InMail
Are you inspired by best-practices and love building new products? Does the thought of creating client-focused, small-business-oriented products inspire you to craft high-quality, well-tested, and resilient TypeScript? Is React your preferred environment to build complex and interactive User Interfaces? Are you looking to apply your knowledge to influence technical and product direction? If so, keep reading; this might be the product development environment you have been searching for.

As a Frontend Engineer III at ChowNow, you will interact with trusted colleagues to contribute code and help build our product platform for growth and sustainability. You will help us launch quality products and support new initiatives to continuously improve the experience of our users (both our restaurant clients and their patrons). You will be an active voice in helping us shape the product by engaging in thoughtful inquiry and critical reflection. We believe positive relationships give our team the ability to exceed expectations. You will collaborate, learn, teach, and experiment with new approaches to enhance and support the platform as we scale.

Our Product and Technology

ChowNow’s front end applications are built on React and TypeScript with Webpack as our bundler. We use SASS and CSS modules when styling our components, and Jest with React Testing Library to test the components and the data stores. Our build pipeline is automated using GitHub, Jenkins and Docker. Our APIs are powered by Python, Node.js , MySQL, and Redis supported by infrastructure-as-code environments on Amazon Web Services.

About The Position

ChowNow is building an ecosystem that helps local restaurants find new customers, consolidate their brand, and improve their operations. It’s time for us to expand the platform, strengthening the relationship between diners and the restaurants they love, and helping our clients grow their business even further. Our current product offering includes a marketplace-web app, an online ordering system, and plans to build additional apps in the near future.

You will join our growing product and engineering team where you will collaborate to solve complex problems with a “quality product first” approach. You will be involved from design to delivery of new features and measuring the success of the product. As a senior member of the team you will have a deep impact on our platform, influencing technology choices, supporting leadership in decision making, and enabling growth of your colleagues.

You will start by learning our business model and how it translates to software architecture and product features. Working with the team, you will take an active part in shaping our technology, bringing the understanding of challenges and opportunities of various implementation choices. On a day-to-day basis, you will contribute to our code base and review the code of other contributors, measure, report, and respond to product and technology-related metrics supporting business growth, and act as the owner of individual pieces of our web applications.

About The Team

ChowNow is unique among tech startups in the restaurant space. We power branded online ordering systems for independent restaurants across North America – via websites, Google, and through branded iOS and Android apps – and we do it all for a reasonable monthly fee regardless of order volume. We operate this way because of our belief in being fair, sustainable, and equitable with our restaurant partners. And the same goes for our workplace.

Diversity, teamwork, and mutual respect are among our core company values. And we pride ourselves on giving our teams plenty of opportunities to make their mark. To date we’ve created over 20,000 apps for our restaurant partners – something that’s never been done before in our category. And as we expand to new markets, further spreading the word about the ChowNow difference, those opportunities to create, build, and grow will only increase. If this sounds like the kind of workplace, and the kind of mission, that appeals to you, we’d love to talk.

Together we can preserve neighborhood flavor, one restaurant at a time.

Responsibilities

You need to be self motivated and self managing. You’ll most likely be given broadly defined goals that’ll require you to break them down into achievable steps and tasks. No one is going to sit around and assign you user stories.
You have to be able to unblock yourself technically if you get stuck OR be very communicative and navigate to the right people to help unblock you. If you’re scared to get on video calls this position probably isn’t for you.

No one is going to hold your hand like a college CS freshman, this is the big leagues. Self independence and accountability is held in very high regard.
The pace and tempo that the team moves at is very fast and very fluid. If you work well in a very structured and vanilla environment then this project is not for you.
We have morning standups where you’re expected to communicate what you’re doing and what your goals are. If you’d rather not do this and just submit jira tickets while hiding in the back, then this project is not for you.
The team looks for suggestions and opinions on how to do things better. We expect you, being the rockstar that you are, to provide advice and suggestions based on your past experience. We are a flat team and everyone’s opinion matters.
Design and build complex and performant web applications using the latest web tooling and modern JavaScript frameworks, including React.js & Redux and Node.js
Write and maintain high-quality code that is well-tested, documented and monitored
Identify UI problems to ensure best solutions for translating design into code
Collaborate with remote, distributed team members, including Technical Architects, Product Managers, Designers and other Engineers, to ship large-scale projects for enterprise clients
Communicate clearly and reliably with team members and/or client stakeholders, who could be CIOs of major enterprise companies, to ensure deliverability along the project’s technical specifications
Take ownership of project success by providing strategic technical guidance and direction, as needed
Work on interesting and challenging problems in the NFT space

Epic,Web Developer,"Los Angeles, CA","TL;DR

High-impact software development jobs for smart people.

Code that saves lives.

As a software developer at Epic, you’ll write software that impacts the lives of 75% of Americans and 250 million patients around the world. Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you’ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you’ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves.

Write software for the most innovative health systems on the planet.

The top-ranked health systems in U.S. News and World Report are Epic customers. Our community includes major systems like the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, and Kaiser Permanente, as well as leading academic medical centers at the University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, University of California, University of Texas, The Ohio State University, and many more.

Work in your own office, eat delicious food, and travel the world.

We don’t believe in cubicles. (Well, we believe they exist, but…) You will work in an individual office that will heighten your ability to get stuff done. For lunch, visit King’s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world. Staff have kayaked in Patagonia, attended a Beyoncé concert in Ireland, built a library in Tanzania, and run a marathon in Antarctica.

Live affordably in a city known for its rising tech talent.

Epic is located just outside Madison, Wisconsin the second fastest growing market for tech talent in the United States and home to the state capital and the University of Wisconsin. Madison, a city surrounded by water, has received accolades for being the greenest city in America (NerdWallet), the best city for renters (SmartAsset), fittest city in America (Fitbit), and, for the gamers, is one of a handful of US cities to have a Killer Queen arcade game, located at Madison’s first arcade bar.

More than just important work.

We offer comprehensive benefits to keep you healthy and happy as you grow in your life and career, and your merit-based compensation will reflect the impact your work has on the company and our customers. You'll also be eligible for annual raises and bonuses, as well as stock grants, which give you an even greater stake in the success of Epic and our customers. Epic is an Equal Opportunity employer.
