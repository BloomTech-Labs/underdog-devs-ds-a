You’re excited to improve mental healthcare and expand the number of people who have access to it.
You know the wellness market.
You care about the wellbeing of others.


Excited to build something from the ground up

You thrive in a fast-paced, scrappy start-up environment.
You’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves to get the job done.
You’re a self-starter; you don’t need instructions to get work done.


Data-driven

You pull insights from data, ensuring new ideas come from member experience and utilization
You seek data and know how to collect more of it when needed
You are excited to receive feedback and grow


A team player

You know it takes a village.
We’re committed to your health and happiness (...which are synonymous, you know).

When deciding what benefits should look like at Real, we started by thinking long and hard about what employees need not only to work well, but to live well. Benefits impact how we act, rest, grieve, set boundaries, and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company, but a mentally well society. At Real, we want to offer our employees more than just ""permission"" to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session. We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.

Payout

Competitive salary, plus equity in an early-stage startup. Emphasis on “plus”—we won’t use equity to low-ball you.


Healthcare

100% company-funded health, vision, and dental insurance. That means no monthly premiums coming out of your paycheck.
HSA/FSA plans
Free One Medical membership
Free Real membership
$1800 annual mental wellness stipend you can put toward therapy, psychiatry, and other mental wellness services
Short- and long-term disability coverage
Life insurance


Retirement

401(k) — we don’t match yet, but you’ll thank us for the compound interest later.


Vacation

Unlimited PTO…that we actually encourage you to take, we promise.


Rest

Quarterly company-wide week off — because sometimes, unplugging is easiest when everyone else is offline, too.
Four-week paid sabbatical after five continuous years of work at Real.


Floating Holidays

Three floating holidays in addition to company-wide federal holidays so you can celebrate what’s important to you.


Grief Break

Real employees receive two weeks of paid time off in the event of losing a loved one. We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.


Parenthood

Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.


Autonomy

Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.
Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.
Autonomous work culture. We don’t have to see a green dot on Slack to trust that you’re doing your job.


Growth at Work

We invest in your career. Our company's growing quickly, and we'll give you the opportunity to do the same. You'll have access to a number of professional development opportunities so that you can keep up with the company's evolving needs and grow your career along the way.


The responsibilities and duties of this position described here are representative of those an employee must perform. This is not a comprehensive list and other duties may be assigned.

We are an Equal Employment Opportunity (""EEO"") Employer. It has been and will continue to be a fundamental policy of Real not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, gender, gender identity, pregnancy, marital status, partnership status, domestic violence victim status, sexual orientation, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, veteran or military status, disability, medical condition, genetic information, caregiver status, unemployment status or any other characteristic prohibited by federal, state and/or local laws. This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including hiring, promotion, demotion, compensation, training, working conditions, transfer, job assignments, benefits, layoff, and termination."

Remote","We are empowering the fight to cure incurable disease.

Today, the “best” option for a patient diagnosed with an incurable disease is a prescription that, at most, temporarily improves symptoms. In the face of this stark prognosis, an alternative treatment option provides an avenue for hope: clinical trials.

SiteRx gives them a better option.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

r2c,Senior Data Scientist,"San Francisco Bay Area
Remote","About R2c

Our mission is to make world-class software security available to everyone. This means building program analysis tools that are open source, easy to use, powerful, and fast. It also means building a team with security expertise and a passion for great developer experiences. Most of all, it means working with honesty and respect in a diverse community of dreamers and builders. We’ve redefined static analysis tooling by committing to all of these, and turned our project, Semgrep, into an essential safeguard for code at Snowflake, Dropbox, and more.

About The Role

You will be the founding scientist for r2c’s data team. Your mission will be to define how an entire company uses data, always striving to best improve our users’ security. You will work on a diverse set of problems, touching every aspect of the startup: extracting product insights from usage metrics, determining business strategy from market data, crafting production data pipelines, and defining where to direct our security research. This is a growth role: while you will start as an individual contributor, you will help grow this team, either by stepping into a management role yourself, or helping us recruit the awesome data-science lead you’ve always wanted.

Along the way, you will work with a dedicated group of full-stack, backend, and infrastructure engineers, as well as security researchers and program-analysis developers. You will learn what it means to have “secure-by-default” code. You will meet and collaborate with security-industry scions. And, as a member of our team, you’ll be a part of the decisions that make a high-growth startup successful. Your work will be critical to our mission. Every feature you build will have a measurable impact on our users’ lives. We’re excited to see what you do.

What You'll Do

Lead data science at r2c; discovering each department’s most pressing data problems, and proactively identifying the most critical areas to focus your efforts
Bring your wide knowledge of data-science approaches to each problem you solve: the first day you might apply multivariate regression to identify important product features, the second you might apply active-learning techniques to guide data collection and labeling, and the third you might work on an AI algorithm to improve security quality for our users
Iteratively tackle problems as a series of experiments, proving the value of your work with proof-of-concept to ever more refined results
Convince your peers of your conclusions with clear data visualizations and well-reasoned explanation
Help grow your team through the recruitment and hiring of top data talent


You are ideal for this role if you have

4+ years of experience in data and strategy fields
Knowledge of data-science approaches; this may include machine-learning algorithms, optimization methods or symbolic artificial-intelligence, but should also include statistical methods and “good-enough” heuristics — and the taste to know when to use each
Experience clearly visualizing information and experimental results
Sufficient familiarity with production data-processing pipelines to construct them working together with generalist infrastructure engineers; tools we use include EMR, Snowflake, S3, and Elasticsearch
Aptitude delivering technical projects via rapid iterative development
Excellent, proactive communication, both verbal and written


Some example projects that you might work on include

Build a statistical model that analyzes pseudonymous usage data to recommend the next features built into the Semgrep open-source tool
Consume infrastructure observation metrics to identify and address potential Semgrep.dev registry outages before they occur
Recruit varied and disjoint data into a “North Star” metric for the performance of the Semgrep open-source tool over time
Craft a security-rule-recommendation decision tree, using codebase features like languages, frameworks, code sentiment, and commit-message sentiment, to deliver targeted, high-value static-analysis rules to users


What We Offer

Our goal is to competitively and fairly compensate every r2cer with a system that equally rewards those who are vocal and those who are less comfortable making demands during the final steps of the hiring process. To that end, we generate internal compensation bands that are used when discussing and negotiating salaries. We update these based on market data to make sure they’re above the average for comparable roles.

We also invest in our employees’ well-being and long term success with comprehensive health plans, generous vacation time, 401k matching, learning stipends, and more. Our benefits are for everyone, so that you’re taken care of, and we work with individuals to make sure they have what they need, whether that’s quiet work space, adjusted hours, or any other accommodation.

Who We Are

We have people from France and the Philippines, physics and philosophy, formal methods research and full fledged corporations. We’re new parents and new grads, aspiring authors and aspiring Americans, dog lovers and dogfooders. We get together often to bike, bake, and meet up in parks. In our interactions, we believe respect and honesty go hand in hand, and prioritize both.

r2c is an equal-opportunity employer seeking a diverse range of backgrounds. We value who you are — including your cultural heritage, your socioeconomic status, your age, your race, your gender, your sexual orientation, your disabilities. We value what’s vitally important to you — your family, your religion, your politics. We value what you love in this world — your music, your weekend pursuits. We believe in welcoming varied professional backgrounds, educations, and interests. If you’re exceptional in your role, believe in r2c’s mission, and treat r2c’s values as your own, you belong here.

You will need working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English. We work as a hybrid on-site / remote organization. r2c primarily works in the Pacific, Eastern, and Central EU time zones."

Overview




The Data Science Team provides advanced analytical support across VNSNY’s family of corporations. We leverage big data to develop insights and to support strategic decisions for the agency. Meaningful, appropriate use of data is central to the success of our organization. We are looking for an ambitious data scientist to join our team.




About the Role




The Senior Data Scientist will join a core group of data scientists who play an important role in generating strategic insights across the VNSNY organization in these four applications of data science:




Clinical - “Who is going to get sick? What can we do to prevent or mitigate these health events? When is the best time to implement these actions?” This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes..
Quality – “How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members?” Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational – “How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members?” This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy – “What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care?” Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.




You Are:




Looking for an opportunity to perform hands-on data analysis and modeling to solve a wide variety of business problems while working alongside clinical/business stakeholders
Driven by curiosity and a passion to learn, you thrive in situations where you can bring clarity to ambiguous and multi-faceted problems
A logical thinker who is comfortable learning new programming languages and computing applications independently
Obsessive about streamlining data and modeling processes; if you find you or your colleagues doing something several times, you create a standard reproducible workflow
Love the challenge of exploring new data sources while practicing a healthy skepticism about data; when you find data that looks wrong, you are emotionally compelled to figure out why
Have a desire to use your analytical skills to make measurable impacts on the lives of patients




Requirements




PhD with 2+ years of experience, or MS with 4+ years of experience, in statistics, biostatistics, mathematics, computer science, data science, econometrics, epidemiology, or other quantitative field

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Nike, Airbnb, Slack, Samsung and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.




About The Role

Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.




What You'll Achieve

You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You’ll explore Notion’s data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)




Skills You'll Need To Bring

You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.




Nice To Haves

You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.




Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we.

If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.
