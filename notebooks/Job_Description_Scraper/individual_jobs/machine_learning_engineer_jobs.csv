Block,"Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Modeler, Risk","Denver, CO
Remote","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

As a Machine Learning Engineer within the Risk Machine Learning team, you work on projects that enable a software-driven, machine learning-centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.

Our algorithms derive value from our unique and rich data from our entire product portfolio within our rapidly growing seller ecosystem. We partner with business, product, operations and engineering teams to drive optimal decision making systems using sophisticated modeling and machine learning. We’re a passionate team of entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers who are shipping machine learning software that actively actively manages Square’s view on each transaction as it pertains to our revenue growth and risk.

You Will

Build machine learning/deep learning models that detect risk (credit or fraud) activity in real-time across our Seller’s ecosystem consisting of payments, banking and debit card products.
You will leverage experimentation mindset along with state-of-the-art algorithms to drive down false positives, collaborate on new product features to drive losses down and explore new datasets (including 3rd party data) to engineer new features for risk models.
Collaborate with business leaders, subject matter experts, and decision makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models

Qualifications

You Have

An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics or a related technical field.
PhD plus 4 years (or Master plus 6 years) industry working experience on applied Machine learning or Deep learning
A strong track record of performing machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, etc.) and SQL/NoSQL interaction patterns.
Expert level knowledge of modern techniques in machine learning and deep learning, e.g., transformer network architectures, with an orientation to maximizing such algorithms in a large scale production setting. Reinforcement learning experience is a plus for developing optimal control policies
Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation.
Machine learning strategic sequencing of methodological and software improvements to work back from maximizing core metrics associated with optimizing the business.
The ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences and stakeholders (PMs, Operations, Engineers).

About Vida

What are we trying to solve?

We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now.

Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered.

Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs, etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change.

At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone.

Why are we solving this problem?

The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change.

Who are we?

We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns.

Other things that we care about:

Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously.
We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village.
We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner.
We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other"

Block,"Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Modeler, Risk","Detroit, MI
Remote","Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

As a Machine Learning Engineer within the Risk Machine Learning team, you work on projects that enable a software-driven, machine learning-centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.

Our algorithms derive value from our unique and rich data from our entire product portfolio within our rapidly growing seller ecosystem. We partner with business, product, operations and engineering teams to drive optimal decision making systems using sophisticated modeling and machine learning. We’re a passionate team of entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers who are shipping machine learning software that actively actively manages Square’s view on each transaction as it pertains to our revenue growth and risk.

You Will

FaunaBio,Data Engineer,"San Francisco Bay Area
Hybrid","Posted by

Linda Goodman

Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at FaunaBio

Send InMail

Founded in 2018, Fauna Bio is an emerging biotechnology company pioneering a novel approach to drug discovery by unlocking the secrets of animal genomics to improve human health. Fauna Bio has raised more than 12MM in seed financing and is focused on identifying genes in animals that are responsible for disease protection and that have strong connections to related human genes. The company leverages insights from extraordinary mammalian traits to develop novel therapeutics that can treat and prevent diseases in humans. Fauna Bio is particularly inspired by the extraordinary physiology of hibernation. Hibernating mammals have evolved to develop mechanisms of self-healing and tissue repair that have implications for human health problems such as heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and muscle loss. This makes them an excellent model system for identifying drug targets because they can transiently protect themselves from problems similar to critically important human diseases, allowing Fauna Bio to identify key protective genes that are turned on or off at medically-relevant times. These insights also translate well to human biology, as hibernating rodents share 92% of genes with humans.




In addition to creating therapeutics to treat human diseases, Fauna Bio is also pursuing gene targets to induce hibernation for long-range space travel. While the program is still in an early stage, our goal is to allow humans to hibernate safely through long journeys.







Opportunity




A key part of Fauna Bio’s strategy is to have a world-class set of rich ‘omics data from emerging model organisms that represent novel therapeutic strategies for multiple diseases with high unmet need. We have built several methods for identifying drug targets including gene network analysis, scoring-based ranking, and a knowledge graph to link diverse data sources. The data integrated in these approaches includes Fauna’s proprietary hibernation data, decades of physiologic studies on hibernators, animal models of disease, and numerous public repositories of human and animal data.




This position will play a critical role in our discovery stage programs by building and maintaining these data resources.




Key Responsibilities:




ETL pipeline management of diverse biological data, with endpoints of both long-term storage (AWS S3) and further computational analysis from SQL/noSQL databases
Optimize storage of Fauna’s genomic and transcriptomic data on AWS S3
Development of effective data validation/verification processes in collaboration with the scientific team







We’d love to hear from you if you:

Have a master’s degree in computational field, data management, OR a bachelor’s degree in one of the above areas with 3+ years of relevant work experience. A minimum of 2 years working with multimodal data repositories is preferred.
Have working knowledge of Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Are proficient in a scripting language such as Python or R.
Are proficient in relevant libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and data.table etc.
Have a good understanding and hands-on experience with databases, specifically PostgreSQL and MongoDB
Have familiarity with genomic data and standard file formats
Are highly organized and have great attention to detail
