When deciding what benefits should look like at Real, we started by thinking long and hard about what employees need not only to work well, but to live well. Benefits impact how we act, rest, grieve, set boundaries, and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company, but a mentally well society. At Real, we want to offer our employees more than just ""permission"" to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session. We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.

Payout

Competitive salary, plus equity in an early-stage startup. Emphasis on “plus”—we won’t use equity to low-ball you.


Healthcare

100% company-funded health, vision, and dental insurance. That means no monthly premiums coming out of your paycheck.
HSA/FSA plans
Free One Medical membership
Free Real membership
$1800 annual mental wellness stipend you can put toward therapy, psychiatry, and other mental wellness services
Short- and long-term disability coverage
Life insurance


Retirement

401(k) — we don’t match yet, but you’ll thank us for the compound interest later.


Vacation

Unlimited PTO…that we actually encourage you to take, we promise.


Rest

Quarterly company-wide week off — because sometimes, unplugging is easiest when everyone else is offline, too.
Four-week paid sabbatical after five continuous years of work at Real.


Floating Holidays

Three floating holidays in addition to company-wide federal holidays so you can celebrate what’s important to you.


Grief Break

Real employees receive two weeks of paid time off in the event of losing a loved one. We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.


Parenthood

Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.


Autonomy

Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.
Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.
Autonomous work culture. We don’t have to see a green dot on Slack to trust that you’re doing your job.


Growth at Work

We invest in your career. Our company's growing quickly, and we'll give you the opportunity to do the same. You'll have access to a number of professional development opportunities so that you can keep up with the company's evolving needs and grow your career along the way.


The responsibilities and duties of this position described here are representative of those an employee must perform. This is not a comprehensive list and other duties may be assigned.

We are an Equal Employment Opportunity (""EEO"") Employer. It has been and will continue to be a fundamental policy of Real not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, gender, gender identity, pregnancy, marital status, partnership status, domestic violence victim status, sexual orientation, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, veteran or military status, disability, medical condition, genetic information, caregiver status, unemployment status or any other characteristic prohibited by federal, state and/or local laws.

r2c,Senior Data Scientist,"San Francisco Bay Area
Remote","About R2c

Our mission is to make world-class software security available to everyone. This means building program analysis tools that are open source, easy to use, powerful, and fast. It also means building a team with security expertise and a passion for great developer experiences. Most of all, it means working with honesty and respect in a diverse community of dreamers and builders. We’ve redefined static analysis tooling by committing to all of these, and turned our project, Semgrep, into an essential safeguard for code at Snowflake, Dropbox, and more.

About The Role

You will be the founding scientist for r2c’s data team. Your mission will be to define how an entire company uses data, always striving to best improve our users’ security. You will work on a diverse set of problems, touching every aspect of the startup: extracting product insights from usage metrics, determining business strategy from market data, crafting production data pipelines, and defining where to direct our security research. This is a growth role: while you will start as an individual contributor, you will help grow this team, either by stepping into a management role yourself, or helping us recruit the awesome data-science lead you’ve always wanted.

Along the way, you will work with a dedicated group of full-stack, backend, and infrastructure engineers, as well as security researchers and program-analysis developers. You will learn what it means to have “secure-by-default” code. You will meet and collaborate with security-industry scions. And, as a member of our team, you’ll be a part of the decisions that make a high-growth startup successful. Your work will be critical to our mission. Every feature you build will have a measurable impact on our users’ lives. We’re excited to see what you do.

What You'll Do

Lead data science at r2c; discovering each department’s most pressing data problems, and proactively identifying the most critical areas to focus your efforts
Bring your wide knowledge of data-science approaches to each problem you solve: the first day you might apply multivariate regression to identify important product features, the second you might apply active-learning techniques to guide data collection and labeling, and the third you might work on an AI algorithm to improve security quality for our users
Iteratively tackle problems as a series of experiments, proving the value of your work with proof-of-concept to ever more refined results
Convince your peers of your conclusions with clear data visualizations and well-reasoned explanation
Help grow your team through the recruitment and hiring of top data talent


You are ideal for this role if you have

4+ years of experience in data and strategy fields
Knowledge of data-science approaches; this may include machine-learning algorithms, optimization methods or symbolic artificial-intelligence, but should also include statistical methods and “good-enough” heuristics — and the taste to know when to use each
Experience clearly visualizing information and experimental results
Sufficient familiarity with production data-processing pipelines to construct them working together with generalist infrastructure engineers; tools we use include EMR, Snowflake, S3, and Elasticsearch
Aptitude delivering technical projects via rapid iterative development
Excellent, proactive communication, both verbal and written


Some example projects that you might work on include

Build a statistical model that analyzes pseudonymous usage data to recommend the next features built into the Semgrep open-source tool
Consume infrastructure observation metrics to identify and address potential Semgrep.dev registry outages before they occur
Recruit varied and disjoint data into a “North Star” metric for the performance of the Semgrep open-source tool over time
Craft a security-rule-recommendation decision tree, using codebase features like languages, frameworks, code sentiment, and commit-message sentiment, to deliver targeted, high-value static-analysis rules to users


What We Offer

Our goal is to competitively and fairly compensate every r2cer with a system that equally rewards those who are vocal and those who are less comfortable making demands during the final steps of the hiring process. To that end, we generate internal compensation bands that are used when discussing and negotiating salaries. We update these based on market data to make sure they’re above the average for comparable roles.

We also invest in our employees’ well-being and long term success with comprehensive health plans, generous vacation time, 401k matching, learning stipends, and more. Our benefits are for everyone, so that you’re taken care of, and we work with individuals to make sure they have what they need, whether that’s quiet work space, adjusted hours, or any other accommodation.

Who We Are

We have people from France and the Philippines, physics and philosophy, formal methods research and full fledged corporations. We’re new parents and new grads, aspiring authors and aspiring Americans, dog lovers and dogfooders. We get together often to bike, bake, and meet up in parks. In our interactions, we believe respect and honesty go hand in hand, and prioritize both.

r2c is an equal-opportunity employer seeking a diverse range of backgrounds. We value who you are — including your cultural heritage, your socioeconomic status, your age, your race, your gender, your sexual orientation, your disabilities. We value what’s vitally important to you — your family, your religion, your politics. We value what you love in this world — your music, your weekend pursuits. We believe in welcoming varied professional backgrounds, educations, and interests. If you’re exceptional in your role, believe in r2c’s mission, and treat r2c’s values as your own, you belong here.

You will need working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English. We work as a hybrid on-site / remote organization. r2c primarily works in the Pacific, Eastern, and Central EU time zones."

UrbanFootprint,Senior Data Scientist - Location Analytics,"United States
Remote","Our Company




UrbanFootprint is the world’s first Urban Intelligence Platform. We provide critical intelligence to the institutions that are rebuilding the world's infrastructure. Where does the energy sector invest in electrification, decarbonization, and asset hardening in the face of climate threats? Where do cities and businesses invest to catch up with e-commerce, last-mile delivery, and new mobility? Where do governments deploy relief and new infrastructure to combat record hunger, homelessness, and hazard vulnerability? UrbanFootprint provides detailed and actionable answers to these questions and more.




UrbanFootprint is ‘Google Maps for the Modern Enterprise.’ We organize, normalize, and align thousands of urban, climate, and community metrics across the continental U.S.. The platform delivers targeted insights via dynamic data streams and collaborative web mapping applications. We enable our customers to answer complex questions in minutes versus weeks, months, or years. Our customers include some of the largest energy utilities, major financial institutions, critical government agencies, top urban planning firms, and fast-growing mobility companies.




We’re growing rapidly in a market with a TAM of $22B, and our competition is old-world manual consulting or outdated software tools that come without the data, the models, or the insights.




Our founders, Joe DiStefano and Peter Calthorpe, are urban planning pioneers who have spent decades providing critical urban intelligence to cities and enterprises across the globe. UrbanFootprint was named one of the World’s Most Innovative companies in 2021, and is on the GovTech 100 list. Our platform was awarded the top spot in FastCo’s Innovation by Design competition.




The role




As a socially-driven Senior Data Scientist, you will be leading UrbanFootprint’s foundational data product, which is a parcel level map of all properties across the US that integrates information about people, employment, land use, the environment and more. This data is fundamental to nearly every decision our customers make. It allows our customers to design environmentally conscious growth plans, target government relief dollars, and promote equitable community development.




As a product-minded and empathetic Senior Data Scientist, you care deeply about how data quality and accuracy impact real decisions. You know how to focus your time and resources to tackle the complex issues that have the biggest impact on our customers. You are autonomous, not independent; you solicit ideas and feedback from stakeholders, clearly communicate progress and are accountable for the validity and accuracy of the models you build and the outputs you ship. You’re thoughtful; you ask questions to ensure you understand the why and verify that UrbanFootprint is tackling the right problems and taking the right approaches. Pragmatic and hands on, you are comfortable designing and executing R+D projects from ideation and prototype to production.




What you’ll do:




Build and execute a technical roadmap that results in measurable product improvements.
Build prototype accuracy improvements to our classification algorithms and related spatial downscaling methodologies.
Partner with urban planning domain experts, customer success and product managers to ensure that model accuracy meets customer needs and expectations.
Design UrbanFootprint’s data labeling strategy to ensure we have the data we need for long term improvements.
Build and define quality metrics that we can track over time to ensure continuous improvement.




Your background most likely includes:




Work experience equivalent to a Master’s degree or higher in Statistics, Data Science or Machine Learning.
Practical experience with a wide variety of statistical and machine learning classification models (multinomial logistic regression, SVM, tree-based methods and/or neural networks), hierarchical modeling, missing data imputation, and/or clustering algorithms.
Fluency in Python and Python’s scientific programming stack such as pandas, sklearn, statsmodels, one neural network library, and one data visualization library.
Experience building your own labeled data.
Experience developing models in an iterative, fast-paced environment.
Excellent communication, collaboration, and documentation skills.




Bonus qualifications:




Deep experience with geospatial modeling such as spatial clustering and spatial clustering with non-spatial attributes, spatial interpolation, and small area estimation and/or spatial downscaling techniques.
Experience as a full-stack data scientist, owning data pipelines, model development and production model implementation.
Familiarity with large-scale data analysis frameworks including SQL, Apache Beam, Dask or PySpark.
