Who are we?  Our product aims to do one thing: make leave not suck. We’re building a simple leave platform for People Teams to support leaves (e.g., new kid, car accident, mental illness, etc.). Most everyone goes on leave. Most everyone hates the leave process. Tilt is fixing that.  We’re committed to iterating towards elegant (and often elusive) solutions to complex problems, whether we’re crafting a workflow system to manage various leaves, modeling a classifier to predict class labels, building a modern API to support partners, or computing complex leave pay.

Doing that requires a lot of autonomy, and everyone here is responsible for a substantial part of Tilt’s future. Each one of us is expected to step up to the plate and deliver on aggressive goals. And everyone shares enormous respect for each other and the hard work that goes into making an insanely great product.  Who are you?
