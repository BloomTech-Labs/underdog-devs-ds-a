5,"Great course - I recommend it for all, especially IT and Business Managers!",5
6,One of the most useful course on IT Management!,5
7,"I was disappointed because the name is misleading. The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content. It deals with two-speed IT in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey website for example.",3
8,Super content. I'll definitely re-do the course,5
9,One of the excellent courses at Coursera for information technology bosses and managers.,5
10,"Is there any reason why you should not apply the course by BCG?)It's content is pretty unique and includes a high level analysis and a wide range of knowledge needed to cover all detailed aspects.Best regards,Oleg Serov",5
11,Excellent course and teachers. Congratulations!!,5
12,This is a good course for an CIO in a non technical company.,5
13,"Good content, but the course setting does (at least for me) not allow learn the content long term due to missing reading material.",3
14,Very structured approach. Thank you for sharing with me.,5
15,"Program demystifies the evolving world of CIOs in a typical global corporation.Coverage being introductory familiarizes participants nicely through some of the nuances & emerging trends.When I took the course participant numbers was fewer, so feedback was quite delayed. So one should plan to be patient to get their peer reviews.Based on peer reviews i sensed much variations in their expectations.Few sections are in French with Subtitles.Subtitle quality requires audit/review.",4
16,Very relevant and useful course designed for CIOs,5
17,This course does not say anything about digitization which is the core subject of the digital wave.,2
18,Videos that are presented in French could've been translated to English.,4
19,"The course content is quite good, though it could have been deeper in some areas.But its peer review system is not working well, if at all.Regards, An Le.",3
20,"Great piece of work, I especially liked a few 'lifehacks' for the CIO",5

23,Very interesting and well-designed MOOC !,5
24,Excellent course! Totally recommended!,5
25,Great course information and content ! Very interesting ! Unfortunately there is a peer graded assignment which 3 classmates must grade. Although two of my classmates gave me all passing grades one classmate gave me all 0's and didn't really justify why; which made me have to re submit my assignment. Thankfully 3 other amazing classmates saw the quality of my work :),4
26,Very interesting course. I learned a lot about the history of Aboriginal education.,5
27,Great content! Learned a lot.,5

45,"This is a really good survey class in the potential of 3d printing, with examples of how individuals can empower themselves and others without the obstacles of traditional tooling, with a relatively short learning curve and low investment. It also demonstrates the ways in which, now and increasingly in the future, we'll all be capable of designing the solutions to our own problems with increasing agility!The only thing that could make it better would be to have more design challenges!Thanks!",5
46,"Excellent course , enjoyed learning :)",5
47,Great course and very informative.,5
48,I'll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing. There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways. The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking.The reason that I've only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework. I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation. I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course.,3
49,This course doesn't contain any new information. It does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known facts.There are better ways to invest your time.,1
50,Great course. I enjoyed learning the material.,4
51,"Excellent course. Good classes, easy to follow, updated content, high quality videos.",5
52,It should be merged with course 1,3

54,very interesting,5
55,"Topics related to the economy or business are not something I am good at or enjoy reading about, this course helped me learn a bunch of useful things I would otherwise not have put effort into studying.",4
56,"I was able to understand materials and devices used in 3d printing, software aspects of 3d printers and get an introductory view of cutting edge applications such as 3d printing in biomedical applications",5
57,"This course is very interesting, enlightening and a wonderful introduction especially for learners with no prior experience with 3D printing.",5
58,Great information and videos. Ready for the next step.Gus,5
59,"If you are interested in having a deeper insight of the 3D printing technology, I recommend this course. There are no prerequisites, all you need is the desire to learn. This course will introduce to to you the different 3D manufacturing methods, and present to you to 3D printing companies that are presently actively. If you want to transitions into the 3D printing field, I believe this course is a good start.",5
60,Full Individuals speaking,3
61,It should be less repetitive and full of useful informations about applications.,3
62,Very good inspirational examples.,5
63,Great course. It provided a great degree of knowledge about applications and the design process.,5
64,it could be easily compressed in a two-weeks course.Sometimes interviews are too long for what they need to explain.,3
65,good introduction into the applications of 3D printing.,3
66,good overview what you can do with this amazing technology.,5
67,This session was too long and a little boring. Could be shorter with the related contents.,3
68,exemplary examples to how 3d Printing can be applied to real world problems.,5
69,"Great content, I still need to go over it to glean the wealth of information that has been put together here.",5
70,"While there is some interesting content, particuarly in the last week on design thinking, some of the course topics don't seem to hold together well, and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads. While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally. If you're not watching, you miss the questions. I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course. I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice.",2
71,"I do not find very interesting this course. too many interviews. It could works for the first course, but not for the second. I was expecting to have more technical material and lessons.",1
72,"Very good in-depth look at the potential applications for 3D printing. I especially liked the sections on development and education. This class gets you thinking about the potential ramifications of 3D printing and how it can change the economy, both locally and globally.",4
73,"A good course to see the various market and non-profit aspects of 3D printing. Lot of examples and initiatives, a",5
74,"Excellent course, could do with a little more visual references. Some of the talks are a bit tough to get through since you are watching 2 people. Content still very valuable.",4
75,"A very complete course, very interesting!",5
76,Great review of what can be accomplished through 3D printing.,5
77,Great class!,5
78,"Super! I did not expect the level of engagement needed to complete the course and it was a very pleasant surprise!Being a layman in the 3D printing revolution, this course really expanded my views on 3D printing.",5
79,A lot of speaking without any sense. Skip it at all cost,1
80,"This is a very basic course on 3D Printing Technology but every aspect of the technology is artistically explained. All the various points of view are considered and a 360 degree idea is passed on to the students.By taking this course, students who are contemplating about their involvement in this revolutionary technology will be able to finally decide their future course of action, which I believe will be positive.In short, this course will provide you a base whereas the further courses, I think (as I haven't taken up the rest of the courses till now but I intend to) will add sufficient value to your knowledge.Regards.",5
81,Great course! Thank you!,5

There are a plethora of interviews with people who are involved with the 3D printing industry, who discuss specific topics in 3D printing, and each offer their views on the future of 3D printing. All the different opinions and perspectives really helped me understand the importance of 3D printing at both an industry and consumer level.

180,"Thank you for this course, very good course.",5
181,"I am very glad to see courses like this one on Coursera. The course itself is well structured and contains a lot of useful information and that is exactly what I needed in one place.My only complaint is the price of the course - I think it is a bit expensive especially for this first part of the specialisation - it is an introductory two week course with a lot of advertising...£40..common..are you serious?? A lot of people will buy personal 3D printers or kits after the course, some of them will make a decision to buy a 3D printer for a company they work for (as myself), Fusion 360 subscriptions etc. These companies should sponsor such courses to make them more affordable - it is their interest.I made several courses on Coursera already (Mechanical and Electrical Engineering), they were 5 to 8 weeks and comprised a lot of quite hard work from mentors and students and were only £32 for certificate.I like the idea of this specialisation but I decided not to pay for the certificate because of its price. Although I am very happy to have access to the courses and I thank you for you effort!",4
182,This is a really great introductory course on 3D printing. I was completely new to the subject and in just two short modules both the basic techniques and some modern day applications were explained in a really clear and engaging manner.I was also really interested to learn about the business examples that made use of these new technologies.Recommended for anyone who is interested in new and exciting techniques!,5
183,Great endeavor! You can now learn about the 3D printing technology at your own place.,5
184,An excellent course. I only wish the portion on non-financial metrics included some examples or insight in how best to quantify non-financial metrics in do,5
185,"week 1 and 2 were kind of boring, but maybe necessary; weeks 3 and 4 were more interesting from a business point of view (i'm not so much interested in accounting as in business decisions).the virtual class of professor Bushee was quite funny :)",4
186,"Excellent course, first 3 weeks were very technical but highly informative. Quite a bit of accounting knowledge is required to understand the work. Last week of lessons were more simple and intuitive to understand, but overall, a very insightful module",5
187,"First of all, I really enjoyed Professor Ittner's presentations. Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course. Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content. I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching. If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating. Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating. But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy. You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost. Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through. While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching. And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers. I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher. There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here. ""I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to"" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're ""stocked"" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that ""we're going to run some narly regressions"", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants. These segments add absolutely zero value. They lengthen the time of the course. To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together.",1
188,This is the first English course I have taken.Though at first it was kind of difficulty because of language(especially the terms) and profession knowledge(it is a comprehensive course and I am still learning courses concerned at school)the course is really worth taking. I have learned a lot .and it stimulates my interest in accounting.,5
189,Thanks for your help.,5

194,Very good course but videos sometimes too long,4
195,A fantastic course,5
196,Really fantastic and interesting intermediate accounting course,5
197,"weeks 1,2 and 3 were not satisfactory according to me. the video lectures were difficult to comprehend. week 4 was very good.",2
198,this is the best course that i ever studied it,5
199,"I love the professors, but unfortunately, I do not feel much connection to me (not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements; I am not an investor, and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statements).The Managerial Accounting (week 4) transforms my mindset!! I really appreciate that. That one single week of course can literally help so many companies/NGOs. That week 4 should be promoted more!!",3
200,"This is fantastic course. The only catch is that it doesn't have Chinese translation, which makes it a little bit more difficult for non-natives to learn. The quality is great.",5
201,"I have only taken one year of accounting in high school before, but the course was really easy to comprehend and engaging!",4
202,It's a very good course.,4
203,The three first weeks were almost completely dedicated to traditional finance accounting ratio analysis.,2
204,"Course was not easy to grasp, lost interest after the first week and I barely got through the quiz at the end.",2
205,"This course is difficult for me since it requires extensive background of accounting studies while my background is in HR and Strategy. However, I grasped the opportunity to make up my finance and accounting related knowledge, and passed the course finally after several times of trial and error. The professors taught the course in a very interesting and fun way, which could have been a boring class with lots of difficult and hard numbers but turns out to be a class full of fun and laughters. I like the way the two professors are presenting the knowledge, as well as doing the analysis. Thanks for providing such a course! More courses like this should be organized to benefit more professionals or students in need!",5
206,Very useful material to financial review of cash flow statements.,4
207,"Very informative course. Prof. Bushee is hilarious,, really like his teaching technique",5
208,"not a big fan of accounting honestly, but i quite enjoy the course. doesn't involve a lot of in-depth math, and its easy to follow.",5
209,"The first three weeks focussed heavily on ratios and detecting fraud and earnings management in an organization, the fourth week seemed to actually relate to data analytics and how non-financial aspects of a company play a role in the financial outcomes. I really do not see where a data analyst who is not in accounting field would be using the fraud detection scenarios in real life. A data analyst would be focused on improving the business and doing the analyses that pertain to improving certain aspects of a business, not finding his manager's earnings management using an M-score etc.",3
210,It was very well done and very informational. Thanks again professors for your dedication and time to educate society!,4
211,My major is accounting but I still felt that it was so difficult. But I learned some knowlege which our teachers didn't tell me. Thanks!,5
212,Departments rigidity to information sharing as an ailment at middle and lower organizational levels was a notable issue,5
213,"This course made me look at Accounting in a very different way; instead of common business schedules, it actually became exciting to read and find out what was really going on!",5
214,Most fruitful course for the most updated Accounting Analytics,5
215,Very informative and interactive. I like the style of Professor Bushee's classroom teaching,4
216,"I believe that it is a fantastic course for those have some basic accounting knowledge and the willingness to enter compliance area. More importantly, the concept linking financial and non-financial decisions are also fantastic to bring accounting to life! I do love both professors in the module!",5
217,great accounting ratio analysis,5
218,Good overview on Financial Analytics!,4
219,"This was very challenging course for me... I felt you needed a strong knowledge base of financial statements to really understand what triggers potential fraud, deception. I think I will need to re-review the course material to reinforce the concepts. Thanks!",5
220,Focus of first 3 week is more of an audit analytics material. Quiz material could have been more interactive. Overall OK course.,4
221,"An excellent course with Professor Bushee, as always (I completed a previous ten weeks course with him, also a superb quality programme of study), very practical, focused and complete, and absolutely enjoyable.",5
222,"Interesting course. Motivating instructors. Tests were sometimes a bit too much about semantics and too little about applying knowledge in a practical way (which the course intro hinted on). But it was good value, manageable next to job and private life and fun to do. You won't regret it.",4
223,This has been a challenging course for a person that doesn't have any accounting experience,4
224,"Professors need to undergo a presentation and Instruction Design skills. They were talking a lot and everything was going over my head, the reason was there were not visual prompt for the examples, specifically in the last week.",1
225,Excellent overview of identification of problems in financial statements,5
226,"This is an excellent course, especially for someone with near zero knowledge of financial statements and their analysis. The concepts are clearly presented, with interesting details and supporting examples of their use. The inane comments by cartoon characters using poorly simulated accents is only mildly irritating.",4
227,Interesting course with good and clear explanation. Easy to understand and with fun!Thank you!,5
228,Very clear. Excellent instructor and it's free if you don't pay for the cert! Can you have a better class experience? Thank you Prof. Bushee!,5
229,Wonderful! Very convenient discourse and utterly concise.,5
230,A very interesting course. Strengthening the advanced accounting concepts.,5
231,It was very breathtakingly and I think that it is the best course within the Business Analytics specialization.,5
232,difficult for people without accounting background to take.,3
233,Good structure... funny prof! ... alot to digest but worth it.,5
234,"The contrast of provided material is quite huge. In first for weeks all the analytics are explained and decisions are shown, in the last week only principles and overall concepts are introduced.",4
235,"I have many hours of undergraduate accounting and finance course work under my belt and this class gives you a tremendous overview of financial statement analysis. The only disadvantage is that the professor creates the workbooks for you and you only have to answer conceptual questions. While this would be great for some, I was hoping for some more hands on work to practice.",4
236,"Excellent Material and instructions. Hard, but valuable",5
237,"Although I am not a native speaker,but I try me best to understand it!Good teacher!Good Coursera!",5
238,Very insightful topic! A good overview of the use of analytics in accounting!,4
239,"was worth the time, thanks professor",5
240,I have thoroughly enjoyed this course. The whole idea of earning management was cool. I will highly recommend this course to all.,5
241,"Awesome Course! Very funny and really sophisticated! The last part is eye opening. Best course in this specialisation!It is not for beginners though, you should have a solid understanding of accounting for the first 3 lectures.",5
242,"Besides serving as a refresher of a few accounting topics, this course really delivers on the topics of analyzing financial statements for possible fraud and linking non-financial metrics to financial performance.",5
243,I really appreicated the tools and techniques presented in the course. Very very valuable for Merger and Acqusition projects that I will be involved in (if ever),5
244,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.,4
245,i love professor Brian J Bushee!!,5
246,Great concise lectures and examples. Useful supplemental files. Entertaining Q&A in Brian's sessions.,5
247,"Rather robust material with strong focus on ""deceptive"" practice detection. A lot of ratio analyses, each with its own moniker which I found tedious. Informative and confirmed that I don't have the ""accountant gene"".",4
248,"Sorry to say but among the four courses of this specialization, this one really disappointed me. Not the fault of teachers or institute, i think the only mistake they made is try to fit too many topics in one course. Anyway this is only my opinion!",3
249,Amazing Course!,5
250,Very practical and complementary for other accounting courses.,5
251,The best auditing course out there!,5
252,"The first 3 weeks demonstrate how to analyze financial performance based on accounting data taken from a company's reported income and investment decisions (10-K for example). The material is presented in an interesting manner with extensive use of Excel spreadsheets to demonstrate the calculation and application of common performance metrics and ratios. The test are challenging and interesting. I retook test I had passed because the information cover was interesting and the test provided an excellent learning opportunity. The fourth week deals with liking non-financial measures to financial performance. Within a typical organization, these parameters are often the ones employees most affect and are often measured against. The concepts and methods of evaluating presented with examples to demonstrate some of the problems with linking non-financial measures to financial performance.I will be able to use what I have learned from both of these classes in my current job. I evaluate current business strategies of my company against competitive business strategies. Since the competitive business strategies must be deduced from a combination of published information and reported financial performance, the first three weeks will be of greatest benefit in this aspect of my job. The last week will be of more benefit as I help business organization within my company develop their business strategies.",5
253,Great content but animations are annoying!,3
254,"With my Accounts/Business/Finance/Statistics Graduation/Post Graduation Education and Teaching & Work Experience, I believe the Professor/Educator who Designed and Presented this Course requires atleast a Basic Training before putting together an important Course like Accounting Analytics.",3
255,Too far from subject,2
256,"The course and the instructor are great, but a missed some referenced material.",4
257,Thanks to the Professor Brian Bushee for the good explanations. I learned a lot. I find the module 4 so difficult for me. The Prof Christopher Ittner is speaking like CNN journalist and not easy for a non native US or English speaker like me to follow.,4
258,I love to be taught accounting by Sir Brian. A very marvellous course.,5
259,Great Course,5
260,"Really good teachers that made a ""boring"" theme (that I had in college) very interesting to watch and study.",5
261,Very good course well presented especially as the topic can be fairly complex.,4
262,Week 4 was the best and the more appropiate for the specialization.,4
263,"Thank you for offering this course. It has taught me a lot of things that I hadn't known. I'm interested in Accounting and there were some times I didn't know where I could gain the materials for study. Now thanks to your courses, I don't need to worry so much. Hope you will continue to produce more",5
264,The Capstone project has been getting delayed since JanDont expect yourself to complete the specialization,1
265,"There was a gap between the prerequisites mentioned on the course details and those stated by Prof. Bushee during the lectures. As such, I found this course a bit harder due to tons of new terminologies in accounting.",4
266,Best course of the specialisation so far.,5
267,Prof Brian Bushee is really excellent but I felt that Prof Chris Ittner's lecture was quite fluffy for an analytics course. Would have appreciated practice problems and case study practices like the operation analytics class,3
268,This course was very informative and can easily be used in any business setting. I can go an apply the methods learned in this course to any organization's financial statement to get a better idea of their financial performance. I really enjoyed in week 4 how the information learned in prior weeks can be tied to nonfinancial measures in developing a causal model to improve the performance of a company.,5
269,Thank you so much for this good-quality course! I benefit a lot. Many thanks to dear professors!,5
270,"Really useful course, concise and resourceful",4
271,"Very interesting course, well designed, using animated fun-makers to shoot out questions that you will probably do it yourself.Course content easy to understand. Very suited for non-accounting major analyst who wants to get some background in accounting analysis..",5
272,Very boring,1
273,"Easiest accounting common sense. If you ever took acct , this will be a wasting of time.",1
274,"While each of the Business Analytics courses have been terrific in their own way, Accounting Analytics was the most challenging and most enjoyable. Accounting + clear information + dogs + sense of fun = a great course. Thank you!",5
275,Extremely useful! I recommend it :),5
276,Very interesting course!,5
277,Content very clear and explained by the professors.,4
278,Brain Bushee's videos are really impressive. Some areas are too technical for a beginner to understand. The rest of the material provide good understanding...,4
279,"Excellent course, professor Bushee always delivers such great explanations.",5
280,I really appreciate this instructor!! He is so considerate!,5
281,Great course!,5
282,Very interesting and provocative course. It will help you to receive additional knowledge which is very valuable.,5
283,"Bushee was fantastic! Ittner was fine, but not as entertaining as Bushee.",4
284,"Extremely useful, powerful and course",5
285,"I loved the Accounting part of the course. It was quite hard for me (non-accounting person), however I really enjoyed the form of the lectures and the content itself (the earnings management + its revealing). Great materials Professor Bushee!",4
286,the Best cour and the Best sitetanks,4
287,"I bit too complicated, as a lot of material placed within 4 weeks of ~15min videos.",4
288,"I recommend this course to all my colleagues. Its enriched content certainly helped me to understand things in better way and provided content in structured way, which is I liked most.",5
289,"While I enjoyed this course and the topics covered, I don't feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to. I enrolled in the Business Analytics Specialization course with a focus on analyzing a business from the inside, not outside. Of the 4 weeks of the course, I'd say that only week 4 was valid from an internal perspective but it was kept very high level. I'd say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis, but not as advertised.I also found the cartoon classroom questions to be very annoying, almost as bad as fingernails on a blackboard.",2
290,Great course. Fantastic ideas around modelling equity returns based business and operational performance,5
291,good overview of analytics options within accounting.,5
292,Great course and great insights!,5
293,"Great working examples to learn Analytics in Financial Statement Analysis. Pace of videos was great. Working excel worksheet gives perfect hands on experience to vary and run the scenarios. Having done ""Introduction to Financial Accounting"" by same professor gave little bit more visibility into reading statements and understanding ratio analysis.Virtual Classroom is getting more new students in each course. I am looking forward to Advance Financial Accounting course.",5
294,Great! As always great lectures by professor Bushee!,5
295,"Very well done! Contents, delivery, clarity, everything was top notch. Thank you!",5
296,This course was one of the toughest courses i pursued so far... I was expecting a lot from this course. from basic to advanced and more of fundamentals. this course should be floated as full specialization rather than as a part of other specialization.,5
297,"This was a good course, no doubt about it. But i felt, that the subject needed more depth that the course framework allowed. I would have liked if it had a part 2 for this course for people who wanted to go little more hands-on in this subject.",4
298,Finally i am able to complete this course. This course was little tougher than the other 3 courses due to some complicated accounting spreadsheet calculations. But i finally i am able to make it. Good Luck to rest of the folks.,5
299,The Best Course in Accounting Analytics.,5
300,Very well thought out. Many useful and applicable techniques provided that can be put to work immediately.,4
301,The course was very helpful. Thanks a lot to everyone who have made this happen!,5
302,"I would add more examples on how to populate the data, even spend time on optional videos where the professor or his assistant goes through testing ratios (something similar to Operations Analytics). I feel like the professor was rushing through his explanations and the models. Maybe people found the course very useful however I felt like there was too much text and immediate switch to Excel file that was elaborated shortly. Overall, I am not sure how to apply these ratios in my final project...",3
303,"First of all, I would like to express my gratefulness to Coursera who presenting this excellent platform for those who is interested in ongoing lifetime education and hardworking and contributions to bring all the greatest courses from top universities around the world.Second, I thank you Prof Brian and Christopher for all your time, work especially your knowledge that you brought and shared within these videos. I truly appreciate and like the way you teaching and delivering the professional knowledge.To me, as a student who's just started stepping in accounting field, I found that accounting classes is so much interesting done by you, and it is a pure enjoyment as I learnt all the key knowledge. On there other hand, the courses gave me a general clear picture of how important and critical the accounting is in daily business management.I will continue study accounting as I pursue my professional goals and career path.",5
304,Lot of considerably complex and dry (accounting and statistics!) subject matter covered at a high level without much discussion! Quiz questions are unnecessarily complex - which (IMHO) will discourage / turn off those who are new to this subject matter in completing this course. The last week is pretty interesting though!I am taking the full business analytic course - and find that the quality and complexity of content is all over the place!! Some are way too simple and some are highly complex.,2
305,"really informative, original and useful!",4
306,This course provides a deeper insight into financial and nonfinancial performance on a pragmatic basis. However the course itself is really brief and the exercises cannot thoroughly provide reliable measure of the understanding of the lectures.,4
307,The course makes accounting interesting and especially the examples are very illustrative. Virtual students bring some fun. The 4th week is however really integrated in the course structure.,5
308,Definitely good course for those working in either accounting or analytics. It gave me new ideas on how to apply analytical methods. Interesting examples on how to identify number management and how analytics can help to set up non-financial metrics that drive financial outcomes.,4
309,Insightful,4
310,Incredibile package.,5
311,"I liked it, although I felt like they were 2 courses: One for the first three weeks, another one during the last week.The ""First Course"" was OK, but it was regular accounting stuff. I was rusty on that so I enjoyed it.The ""Second Course"" was the one related with Analytics.I give it 3 Stars because you can see some lack of preparation in the team. And because didn't made a proper link between Accounting and Analytics.",3
312,Thanks a lot for putting up such an amazing course,5
313,"Challenging course, a mixture of forensic and investigation method in accounting",5
314,A technical but fun exploration of accounting analytics which completed the full gamut of analytics in a business context covered in the specialization.,5
315,Prof Brain is just superb. His hold and teaching ability of complicated subject of accounting is unmatched.,5
316,Thank you!,5
317,Vote for Pro. Bushee!,5
318,Good course if you are a beginner. Analytics is only 1 module (#3) and it is a good one.,4
319,Excellent course for aspiring financial analysts,5
320,i love this course very much!very practical and systematical content.and very useful for accounting professionbut its a little bit challenging to follow. I have watched whole the videos for more than 2 times in order to pass the assignment.,5
321,"It's ok. Bushee is very knowledgeable and a very enthusiastic teacher, but his lessons are too dense compared to the content in the rest of the Wharton BA programs. I actually like all the detail, but I think it's covered too quickly and the course should probably be made longer to deal with it all. There are ratios and balance sheet jargon just flying at you at a breathless pace. It would be better to focus on a few key ones and then walk through the examples a little more slowly. The quizzes were extremely tricky with too many choose more than one answers. It was difficult to find the parts of the video to review missed questions because 1) the transcripts are machine generated and make it difficult to search specific words and 2) it's difficult to remember where the concept was covered because there was so much in each video.The last week felt very disconnected from the first week and like it belonged in a different course almost. It was pretty good, though. I liked how it contained specific examples and charts.",3
322,Great introduction to Accounting Analytics. Unexpected lecturing dialogues. Could have more analytics or additional or optional problem sets to explore more deeply.,3
323,"I believe this is a very good course. Even I'm am a software engineer, I can understand how to manipulating the finacial report and how to detect them.",5
324,The Professor is really amazing. He makes every lecuture interesting and easy to understand.,5
325,Outstanding teacher and metodology. Best course of this kind i've come accross out of Business Schools and MBAs.,5
326,Excellent Designed course. Thanks,5
327,Excellent online course that caters to a wide spectrum of audiences with different learning backgrounds.Also love the cut scenes to the classroom where students make funny comments or ask questions haha,5
328,"Five stars is not enough to express my satisfaction and love to this course.The instructor is very proactive in community. Every questions I posted got direcly feedback from Teaching staff (and most of them are from Prof Bushee!!!)This is the besttttt course among all Wharton analytics sessions! Honestly, you have to try!!",5
329,"A little tough sometimes, but very instructive",4
330,"This is my feedback as a Beta-Tester for the course:Week 1I thought that the videos were clear, well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the “tell me what I just told you type” but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students “play” with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two… “change the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?” I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going “yeah… that makes sense. I understand…” I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don’t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require “parroting” something said in the video.I’m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder’s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a “think about what this means” type question that is not necessarily “marked” but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they “go look at the spreadsheet”. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more “hand holding” and “direction” in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little “scary” for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I’m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes – this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 – Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 – talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an “increase means slower future recognition”. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 – no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford’s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures – some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students – particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students – perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don’t need to be long or complicated – just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to “play” with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of “messing” it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a “playground” sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another – so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios – one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don’t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course. I hope that my comments are helpful and that I have not missed too much that causes students issues as the course goes live.",4
331,"Thank you very much for this awesome course, I really enjoyed and learned alot from it.I really liked the selected topics, they act like an intro to some really interesting fields in the programming.I've learned about NP multiple times but never found a use to it until now, the problems were really good and informative.I think the linear programming was pretty rushed, it should've been expanded over two weeks with more in details.Maybe add a problem or explain the use of duality .",5
332,"I didn't like that course because of:-weak explanations of algorithms-almost all assignments I googled, I spent all my time googling these algorithms-when code is submitted and something goes wrong It is not possible to understand what is really happened",1
333,Nice one.,5
334,poor course. never give any algorithm. No clue where the problem come from. The forum is only help a few people. No general ideas how to solve the problem. waist a lot of time debugging but still couldn't pass the assignment.total waste my time and garbage course.,1
335,While I like the content of the course but I felt too much of topics were crammed into one single course. I had to struggle a lot to grasp the concepts on advanced algorithms by just relying on video lectures so I had to look around in the internet for additional resources. Nonetheless it was a satisfying experience though it took me a lot of time and effort to complete the assignments.,3
336,"Loved what I learnt, I also implemented a project using Google MAP API for the organization I'm working at",5
337,"Inadequate student and teacher participation on forums, leaving students to figure things out without assistance or collaboration. Insufficient explanation of math concepts required to fully understand lectures.",2
338,"The problems are really challenging, thank you! However, the instructor is not very active in the discussion forum, which is a pity when you really need help and get stucked in the problem set.",4
339,"Excellent but tough course ,you need to work and it is not simply called advanced Algorithms and Complexity.You will be forced to test your code properly ,even if you didn't do it properly in the previous specialisation course.",5
340,Thank you very much. I learned a lot in this course. I recommend it!,5
341,"I enjoyed the course a lot. I cannot thank the instructors enough.It would have been more interesting if we could go deeper on linear programming, such as extension to integer programming. The discussion about the duality was a bit too fast to me.",5
342,"easy to undestand, but it needs more examples",3
343,Good one!,5
344,"Great intro to Ableton, with good hands-on experience. Nice starting point for those who seek to expand their music creation toolset.",5
345,great fun and easy to learn.,5
346,"I personally think that I've learnt more from Google and YouTube then in this course. You can join the course for certification. Other then the certificate, I find this course not much of value.",3
347,The course gives a good basic overview of the softwareAs a newbie to DAW software it helpsActually needed it to determine if I was going to purchase the full versionI will be,5
348,Offers a nice introduction to Ableton and its Usage. However it would have been lovely if this was a longer course.. Loved the way of instructions and the topics covered.,4
349,really great course,5
350,Really useful for beginners!!,4
351,must have if you want to start using ableton,5
352,"Excellent course.Great content, tasks and learning environment.It helped me to rediscover my love for creating music and how well suited Ableton is to my way of working.",5
353,"Good as a introduction, but there was only a few people on blend so it was hard to earn their votes, hope there will apear some intermediate or advanced courses.",4
354,"Great introduction to Ableton 9 for a newcomers. You'll learn basics, but those that are enough to start create music.",5
355,Awesome course for an intro or to just refresh your skills.,5
356,it's awesome for beginners!,5
357,"Cool, The best i did on line.I learned a lotThanks you very much.",5
358,to easy. enjoy everyone! also children to old papa anyone.thanks for Erin Barra,5
359,"Great introduction to Ableton. If you love music, this can change the way you create sounds, melodies, rhythms,...",4
360,If only it was a week longer.,4
361,This is a great course for people who do not know Ableton. The exercises were easy to understand.,5
362,"A very good course for getting a quick and effective introduction to one of the coolest DAWs around! Barra has explained everything nicely, and in an easy to grasp manner. Go ahead if you're looking for digital music production even remotely!",4
363,Perfect Starting point to Ableton Live!!!,4
364,Mo comment went way too fast no contact not deep,1
365,"As thorough as possible given the time constraints. Erin Barra did a terrific job of condensing the material . I ended up appreciating the appeal of Ableton Live -- which is to say, a non-linear, clip-based DAW. The program (and Push) is endless, and I'm still learning all sorts of things. Good to have this basic foundation to work from. Thanks....!",5
366,Great for beginners and if you want to get into Ableton DAW,5
367,"Very good course, I really wish for a next more advanced level course.",5
368,"Excellent experience. Material, instructor and pace of the course were really good.",4
369,A well-presented and thorough introduction to the fundamental tools available in Ableton Live.,5
370,A great course to teach the basics of this software!,5
371,Thank you Ms professor Erin Bara you are the pest,5
372,"Gives a soft view and precise information about what to do and how to do in Live.If you are looking for some input to start recording yourself or to start creating any kind of music, i strongly recommend this!",4
373,Great class for learning the fundamentals and basics within Ableton live 9. Projects are realistic and designed to educate a student no matter their level of knowledge.,5
374,Great for getting me started. I feel much more confident in navigating my way around the Ableton workspace. Using blend has opened me up to some wonderful ideas and opportunities :),4
375,Please create another course,5
376,Fantastic and helps you create music that represents you.,5
377,Fully recommend if you want to dive into Ableton Live,5
378,Great course with an even greater lecturer who helps ease users into Ableton Live.,5
379,I learned so much in this class and the instructor did a great job explaining the contents,5
380,Great course!,5
381,Very light and practical course. Good for beginners but also nice to refresh some tips for intermediate users.,5
382,it's a great course for people who want to learn easily the base of this program!,5
383,Very helpful in acquiring necessary knowledge about Live. I would recommend this course to several others like me interested to get their hands on Ableton.,4
384,An excellent introduction to an extremely powerful Digital Audio Workstation - one which I had used for a few months but still learned a great deal from the course.Highly recommended. :),5
385,Great course,5
386,Don't recommend.You're better off skimming through the ableton manual and using the search function to get the answers you want.,1
387,Good course . A must take for beginners !,4
388,Great introductory course for ableton!,5
389,"I loved! Easy to learn, easy to understand. Now i can to use my Ableton and work on my productions. Very nice teacher!",5
390,"Simply an introduction but definitely helps learn the program, at least on a surface level. You will gain basic functionality and be well on your way to crafting more complex arrangements if you desire.",5
391,Erin Barra is an excellent teacher; one of the best I've ever encountered. The course plan is well thought out and structured so that absolute beginners as well as those with Ableton experience can benefit. Highly recommend!!!,5
392,Really great course! The videos were very clear and I learned a ton about a program I've been using for years to record audio only.,5
393,"One of the best introduction to Ableton Live. This course is sharp, to the point and makes you sketch out a small track every week - a great way to get involved with the DAW.",5
394,Loving this course,5
395,Great course to start working your way around all the incredible tools Ableton offers.,5
396,I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week. I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description . Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.,3
397,Excellent overview and practice for new ableton live users.,5
398,"I have learned so much about using Ableton Live in this course. It really gives you the basic of the program and then some which is really great, especially when you want to use this program for producing and or recording. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Ableton and Berklee Online.",5
399,Excellent to start learning.,5
400,"It's a great course. The teacher is the best, very direct and understandable.",5
401,As an introduction course its very helpful. It has just what you need to get started.,5
402,"A very nice experience. I expected an entry level course, but Erin organised a well rounded path. I got a new effective approach to the Ableton Live 9 software.I recommend to develop carefully your assignments: you will improve your own skills by comparing your solutions with those of the classmates. In addiction you'll find some ""veteran"" student willing to help.Good luck!",5
403,"While I did not have time to complete the final assignment I did find this course useful for creating a firmer understanding of Ableton Live. The peer review process is a great idea and something which I found to be both engaging and useful for networking with fellow artists.The content of the course I feel is probably useful to someone with no prior knowledge of DAWs, but this is not my first DAW. As such the course felt a little slow and the assignments a little unchallenging. Personally my peer review experience ranged from listening to fully fleshed out ideas to listening to uninspired loops of nonsense. I still feel as though I benefited from the process, however, and I gained an invaluable resource in Blend.I would love a next level - fleshing out some of the ideas touched on throughout the course, as well as exploring other ideas such as sidechaining.",4
404,I've started producing with live in a week. Amazing and clear course.,5
405,Brilliantly designed course for fundamental understanding of the DAW.,5
406,"This course covers a lot of ground in a short period of time, and does it in a way that makes it easy to quickly leverage the power of Ableton in production and live performance. I appreciated the simplicity and thoroughness of the videos, and the assignments kept me motivated. It's a great class for complete beginners, as well as intermediate users in need of a brush up. Erin has a good approach to teaching: she's efficient and clear, and her basic examples don't overwhelm the student.",5
407,it's a great introduction to ableton but nothing more,4
408,Keeps me connected to music and music technology even in my work life,5
409,"Learned a lot. Got me started and using the program, and making music.",4
410,"This is a great intro class, designed to be completed within the Ableton trial period. Ableton should pay Erin a commission on sales that come out of this course, because I imagine it's bringing them 100s of new sales!The materials (mostly videos) are excellent and easy to follow. I learned a lot in this short class and would love to see an ""intermediate"" Ableton class in the future.My only complaints are related to the collaboration software that you need to use for this course, blend.io. Site navigation in blend.io can be painfully slow, and the site is buggy. I would have preferred to simply share information via dropbox or some other file sharing method.The peer review process is a great idea, although I think it's really tricky to do this in a music/art, because there is so much subjectivity and not much of a rubric. (There are some quantitative questions just to verify that the student follows instructions, but the open feedback is totally open). But, overall, the peer review works pretty well and gives students an additional incentive to turn in a quality product.",5
411,Great course. Won't say anything else... if you want to know how it is you must try it!,5
412,"Great introduction to Ableton Live. Covers all stuff you need to know, and helps you through some stumbling blocks.",5
413,"Excellent introduction to live 9. Very comprehensive, easy to understand.",5
414,Awesome course for those who want to learn Ableton´s Live DAW!,5
415,Excellent for learning the basics!,5
416,"Great course! For very short time you'll learn so many amazing things. You will know in depth one professional software for music composition. You'll create 3 compositions which will be placed in musical website and hundreds or thousand of other musicians will hear it and vote for it. You will be part of wonderful group of other musicians like you taking part in the same course. You will be able to discuss with them important subject's... Great course. Thank you, Erin, David!",5
417,Really good resource for anyone wanting to learn the basics of a super flexible software.,4
418,"Great instructor, I like how you can go back and keep going over the instructional videos throughout the course.",5
419,This course is a challenging into to Ableton Live. It is well worth the time for even experienced producers who are new to Ableton Live. I first got Ableton Live in November 2015. It is now January 2016 and I feel like I have come a long way thanks to this course.,5
420,Fun course! Excellent for beginners. By week two you are able to make an arrangement already.,5
421,"Great to start with Ableton, even i start with some youtube tutorial, this course really works for me cause i can see some errors i did.",5
422,interesting and easy learning!,5
423,"The MOOC teaches what it is supposed to, although more classes would be nice since Ableton is such a big program.",5
424,Erin is a great and easy to follow instructor! Thank you.,5
425,"Great Course, lots of feedback from your assignments!",5
426,"anyway, I can start to make music after this course.",5
427,Thank you so much for this course. Really... very neccesary and important for people who loves music.,5
428,"I never ever would have gotten started with Ableton if it weren't for Erin's course. She made it SO easy to understand. For years, people have tried to explain it to me but only Erin succeeded in making it sink in! This course ROCKS.",5
429,Very good course for learning how to work in Ableton. Professor Barra teaches really great.,5
430,GREAT!! thanks a lot :) :),5
431,"The course is an awesome intro. It could be longer! These Coursera Berklee courses are so short, sometimes they feel like advertisements for the Berklee online courses.",5
432,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The time commitment required for each week's assignment was perfect. I learned several techniques to aid me in going forward in my musical endeavors and look forward to many years of continuing to explore Ableton Live.,5
433,Great course waiting for level 2 :),5
434,Great course! Helped me to get started with Ableton Live.Video lectures were straight to the point.,5
435,Excellent! the best way to learn!,5
436,"At this moment, I'm in the week 2 and I'm loving it...I'd really recommend it.",5
437,Very good instructions of the teacher!,4
438,"Very good introduction to this software, teatcher is great and very easy to understand. I have learned a lot of good stuffs such as how to warp audio, convert audio to midi and so on... I was used to work on cubase and I have discovered the specifities and the advantages of Live.Moreover thanks to the assignment objectives I had to force myself to be creative and It was a great feelig.Thanks for this course :)",4
439,Great starting point for learning how to use Ableton Live.,5
440,"Really nice.. Basic, but just right..",5
441,This course got me fluent enough with using Ableton that I can sit down and play around with it comfortably and create music. Very pleased,5
442,"This was such a cool way to get started again with music production!!...I'm so glad I found this course, and Erin was perfect, she made everthing so clear and easy...I wish it was a longer course tho!",5
443,"It's amazing that we live in an age where you can take online classes like this for free.I went from not knowing my way around Ableton to being able to make simple tracks in a few weeks.The course load is pretty light, but it makes it easy to stay motivated and keep up from week to week.The instructor has her quirks, but don't we all. I feel like this course is great for introducing someone who has prior experience with writing music and using DAWs to Ableton Live. However, for someone who already knows the basics of Live, this probably won't be of too much use.",3
444,I enjoyed very much the lessons and I had a very good time on preparing the assignment on Ableton.A great course.,5
445,"It helped me to improve myself, understanding Ableton Live and getting better in working with the program.",5
446,"Awesome, Useful, very practical! Erin is a wonderful instructor.",5
447,A great course. It does teach you the essentials on how to begin making music with Ableton live. It even helps you search on your own if you troubleshoot. Its definitely worth it!!!,5
448,Very good course for does how just starting with Ableton.,5
449,"Great, specifically for its collaborative approach.",5
450,"This is an amazing course ! it is my second time taking it. Instructor Erin Barra does a great job with the tutorials, she really knows her stuff.",5
451,I have being waiting for this a long time :),5
452,Good information!,4

454,"work motivational, very clear, well structured on a steady groove ... excellent!",4
455,Very good basic course. Enjoyed it very much,5
456,I am very grateful i came across this Course.,5
457,Very interesting.,4
458,Very useful !,5
459,Its just the best!,5
460,Great Introduction into the program....a quick look. I felt the tutorial in the program covered a lot and most of the info here can be found on youtube. Although you don't get a certificate for watching youtube,4
461,It is very nice for people are starting with abletobn program,4
462,"For anyone getting started this is a great course to do it with. I'm retaking this course as a refresher since I took the same class in the beginning of the year. I've been very busy so I forgot some functions. The videos & explanations make it very easy to get reacquainted. Plus what's more fun than getting some more production in, hearing your own creations & everyone else's for that matter. =)",5
463,"This is already very, very helpful with mastering the use of Ableton, understanding how the I/O functions work, and polishing a track to the mastering level. Great program and very intuitive!",5
464,Great overall introduction to start creating straight away. Liked it much!,5
465,"Great course, I just wanted it to be more thorough :) But for beginners like me, it really helped a lot! Thank you!",4
466,Excellent introduction to Ableton,5
467,Definitely recommend this short course which gives a good overview of Ableton Live's capabilities and how to use them.,5
468,I love it!,5
469,"good, straight to the point Course, you can learn other things in this course like Blend.io",5
470,I'm now taking this course a second time because it is so absolutely helpful and has really given me a free and friendly place to learn how to use Ableton and get started on music production!,5
471,Very helpful,5
472,Erin Barra is awesome..!!! Really good course to get up to speed with ableton.,5
473,Excellent Course... Erin Barra is really excellent in teaching. Now I can proudly say even i can work in ableton live nicely. Thank you Coursera,5
474,Great intro. Really gave me confidence with the DAW.,4
475,You don´t need anything else to get started with Ableton...,5
476,This is a great course to introduce anyone interested in music production. I would recommend this course to any and everyone. Thank you Berklee and Erin! Can you tell I enjoyed this.And the Beats continue.Johanna -JKM,5
477,"Really, really nice for learning the basics of Ableton Live. The instruction videos are short and concise, and there's a clear path forward after the course.",5
478,Great class to get your feet wet with ableton.,5
479,Everything on this course was amazing!Congrats and thanks so much for all!,5
480,Great course. Got me started off with Ableton live. :),4
481,"It was fun. Have peer review is helpful. However, it was mainly one time comment. It would be great to start conversation and interaction among course takers.",4
482,Great tools and solid instructions. Thanks!,5
483,This was an excellent course that was well explained and easy to follow.,5
484,"Fun and interesting course. I learned a lot, despite already being a Live user. Reviewing the assignments of other course-takers widened my horizons and helped me gain valuable insights.",5
485,"Real a great course if you are looking to learn the basics of Ableton Live 9 or just need a refresher after the break. Erin does a wonderful job of explaining the basics with out overloading you with to much information. Each assignment is to make a song. It starts with basic stuff and works toward more advanced stuff near the end. It's helped motivate me to put more time into making music and use the tools and software that I have at my disposal.A personal thanks to Erin, this class is just what I needed!",5
486,"Fantastic Course, i have saved the videos so i can review them again.I thoroughly enjoyed it, all over again. This was the second time i joined Introduction to Ableton Live but this time i decided to get my verified Certificate yay! Thank you Erin!",5
487,"Thank you so much Jeff, iy was usefull course, i think it needs to extend the material and learning's period.Thank you so much!!!",4
488,Very excellent class. Lots of great information.,5
489,i had a great knowledge !thanks for offering this course i don't have such course in india .,4
490,Very nice course,5
491,Awesome Course. It was quite challenging though,5
492,"This particular module (week 3) is written for those students who are already have at least a nodding acquaintance with the software.The videos move so fast that I am not able to detect what is going on. Please believe me when I say that I run a copy of Fusion 360 at the same time as a particular instructional video is playing. I toggle from one to another, taking notes from the instructional video when possible. Still, it takes me weeks, not days, to understand what the professor is doing.It is true that there are several online tutorials with regard to using the sketch tools contained within Fusion 360. I have been reviewing the tutorials that I am able to find -- and I have learned quite a bit of ""how-to"" information that this particular module does not provide.Why is it that some of us who are new to the Fusion 360 environment have come to understand that we need to spend hours of our time to ""fill in the blanks"" of week 3?Are we to keep searching other sources so that we can learn what has not been taught in Week 3? If so, why?Bill Clark",3
493,"This course introduced me to the different software tools that can be used for 3D Printing. I recommend this course, as well as this specialization, to anyone interested in 3D Printing.",5
494,more details on ther software would definitely be useful,5
495,"The instructor does an excellent job, but realistically there is no way to be proficient enough in a 3D software program after a week or two to earn a certificate. The certificate is worthless in my opinion. I liked the class but it seemed more like intro vs. a class of any proficiency required.",3
496,"The course was enjoyable for the most partand I increased my skill level. The videos, for the most part, were good. However, consider revising some of the one for Fusion to include demonstrations for the sweep, loft, and revolve tools in the Sculpt mode if they are to be included in assignments. These were not as intuitive as the others and required reliance on videos found on Autodesk as well as Youtube. Additionally, it would be helpful to slow the pace in illustrating ""how-to"" in the videos. There seemed to be steps omitted and I found it difficult at times to reconstruct all the steps. Finally, I noticed that staff/mentor help was not readily available for weeks, when participants posted queries in the forum.",4
497,This class was inspiring! I't was worth the wait. Thank you!!,5
498,Very interesting course. Maybe Fusion 360 may have lasted one more week to get more indepth knowledge,5
499,"I wanted to give only 4 stars because of the all the “problems” we encountered, but then we are learners investigating problem solving by design thinking. We can handle whatever comes, so the fifth star is for us. We are shaping this course by contributing to forums. Presumably we are ten thousand strong, let’s improve our worldwide voice by saying something on forms so we can get what we need and want we want also to stay on the cutting edge of reality.",5
500,Interesting and very useful course.,5
501,It gave me a good understanding of the software capabilities.,5
502,the introduction to Fusion is more a customer presentation to advanced CAD user than a tutorial for newbies.,2
503,Wow! It was such an inspiring journey!,5
504,"The bi-weekly assignments mixed with the bi-weekly lessons is a really great course structure. The audio on some of the videos interviews can be poor, and I wish some lectures, especially the last one were more in depth, but over all great course with a good pace.",4
505,Excellent course you should make more courses like this,5
506,"it was really an amazing experience , wonderful course with a lot of knowledge to learn , a lot of facilitations that make studying process very interesting , thanks a lot for your efforts , I'm very enthusiastic to have a visit to the Leiden medical school and center one day ^_^ and continue to learn from such a great medical staff =D",5
507,I loved this course. I've been teaching Anatomy to physical therapist students for two years and this course helped me a lot to improve my teaching. Thank you for your hard work!,5
508,Very interesting course! Great videos and instructors. T,5
509,I'm so glad Leiden University is working with Coursera. Such a great course!,4
510,"This is a great course, i am happy that you gave me the opprtunnity to get a certificate. Its a subject i really feel i gain more knowledge now.",5
511,"Well-organised , Very good for beginners and intermediate learners .",5
512,Great course!,5
513,i never saw like this very very amazing worki would like to repeat this course 10 times,5
514,I love it ! Thanks for doing this for us,5
515,iam soooo happy to joined to this course which help me to evaluate my skills and increase it,5
516,A good refresher in abdominal anatomy. Though with some negatives. The accent was difficult to understand at first. Most of the course content is for beginners in undergraduate level. Yet it is still good.,4
517,Do you have an idea how lucky you are to have access to a course like this?! Normally you would have to be enrolled in med school.,5
518,Fantastic videos walking through anatomy on a real human body!,5
519,difficult course that is full of information but if anatomy is your 'thing' then this is a very good course to take.,5
520,incredible content and resources!,5
521,"I really want to thank you all! In fact ,i never have experienced that awsome lecture! The embryology is the most diffucule lesson to me,and through this lecture,I don't think it is boring and hard to understand.At the same time, I really acknowledge using what you have leraned is the coolist thing in the world.You can figure out how responsible the teachers are(include every individuals who participate in this lecture's making) !thank you all again!!",5
522,Perfect,5
523,"Tough course, but fascinating and very well presented. I was never going to pass the final test because I just do not need to know the detail. However, I'm very grateful to have got to the finish line. Thank you.",5
524,amazing course help me alot,5
525,"is a very very boring curse, don't recommend anyone, please for your good at everyboduy else kill this course, don't embarrass yourself and the universities that represents",1
526,"Outstanding, clear, well-explained, not overwhelming. Dissections really aid to have a more realistic understanding. Good supplemental materials cover the material with great focus, and if more details are needed it is easy to get those elsewhere. Great effort by U. Leiden!",5
527,it is a very good course escpecially for medical student,5
528,Just awesome!,5
529,Excellent!!! I am impressed; they explain very well and it is very interesting to learn from them despite their accent.,5
530,great course with great dissection videos. course materials are very interesting. I understood the anatomy of the abdomen which medical school couldn't teach me.,5
531,very hard course but extremely detailed one.,5
532,I am dropping this course. don't e-mail any more for this course. How do I unroll in this course.,1
533,"V difficult, but rewarding!I did not get the grade I thought I would in this class...but I learned a lot more than I thought I could! Very in depth and thorough, I think I value the knowledge I received more than the sub-par grade I received. ;)",5
534,"The course itself is 10 out of 10: overwhelmingly informative, presented in a totally engaging manner, lots and lots of visual aids. Fly in the ointment: teaching assistants (called mentors here) apparently have come from very different (including hierarchical) societies and learners are required to take the mentors' diversified background and attitude into consideration. Not vice versa.",4
535,very hard but excellent course,5
536,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.,5
537,"Nice course, a difficult one but very challengeable. Nice structure and easy to understand.I wanted to refresh my knowledge in anatomy and in such gained a whole lot more in return.Thanks to the Professors for their time and effort in making this MOOC.Very pleased.",4
538,"Not meant for learners new to the medical field. Despite the challenges, the material is very fascinating and anyone interested in anatomy will learn something. The course utilizes outside research. I might enjoy the whole course experience more if the design were not so technical. I do, however, appreciate the challenge and seriousness of the topic.",4
539,"Great course, like the way of teaching. Really starts from noting and goes to a senior level of knowledge.",5
540,"Very good material, explainations and teachers. Recommended for everyone who wants to learn.",5
541,Im loving it so far.,5
542,"Very good course, still in the beginning, but liking so much.",5
543,Excellent course and well designed. Even though some of the concepts where harder for me to understand I now have a basic understanding of the structure of the abdomen.,5
544,Nice and necessary course.,5
545,Me gusto mucho,5
546,me gusto mucho,5
547,chevere,5
548,"I loved it, was very funny and relaxing.",5
549,"EXCELENTE CURSO.GRANDES TUTORASEXCELENTE METODOLOGIA DE ENSEÑANZA Y APRENDIZAJE.SE ABORDARON LOS TEMAS DE MANERA ENTENDIBLE, COMPRENSIBLE Y CON RETOS QUE INVITAN A RAZONAR Y APLICAR LOS CONOCIMIENTOS ADQUIRIDOS.ESPERO PIENSEN ELABORAR UNA SEGUNDA ETAPA DE INTERMEDIA Y AVANZADA",5
550,So far the course is just a tutorial for using Scratch and they're not teaching how to program that is the name of the course.,2
551,Muy buen curso para aprender Scratch.,5
552,Very wonderful course to learn the basics of programming using the amusing and interactive language Scratch,5
553,"A course offering very accessible, clear introduction to the concept of programming seen as a network of algorithms, supplanted with a myriad of real-life examples. It then introduced a comely intuitive software, developed by MIT - Scratch, which enables you to practically start creating animations and thus programming. Even though i'm not a fluent hispano-hablante, just the knowledge of English and some classical culture should make it possible for you to follow. At the same time, should that be too complicated, there should be subtitles/English language version to all the videos and of all other materials. Have NOT tried that though.",4
554,Very easy and good explanations,5
555,cool,5
556,"The male Professors seem to speak Chinese half the time, therefore not being able to understand the material for students who aren't fluent in Chinese. I prefer the female Professor from Advanced Neurobiology I who presented the material in English, and in an engaging and coherent way.",2
557,"The topics are really interesting and advanced! However, there's a lot of talk in chinese, due to questions/answers from teacher and students, and the quizzes are a bit too easy. I learned a lot though.",3
558,"If you don't speak Chinese it's a terrible course...The lectures are recorded from lectures at university and the rhythm is very slow and not very well explained (at least the first week). The transcriptions into English are incomplete, so understand this course is very very complicated.I do not recommend it at all.",1
559,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!Really Advanced course with many many resources!,5
560,This course teaches us tips of effective and constructive way of discussing !,5
561,I like the way it's presented.,5
562,Great course and very great exercises,5
563,Great Course... Although I feel we must discuss more case studies,5
