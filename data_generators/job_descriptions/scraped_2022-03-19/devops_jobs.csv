Flex Rental Solutions,Junior DevOps Engineer,"United States
Remote","We are looking for a Junior DevOps Engineer to join our engineering team. We are looking for someone with 1-2 years of experience in a DevOps or IT related role with exposure to AWS or other other cloud providers. This is a fully remote role for anywhere in the United States. Travel to Carlisle, PA may be expected once a year.

You will work as part of an established, yet growing development team that writes and manages our Flex Rental SaaS product. Individual contributions have a great deal of impact for our customers and for the rest of the team. If you enjoy working with smaller team sizes, thrive with a large amount of autonomy, and don’t mind some ambiguity, then Flex may be the right place for you.

The core responsibilities are working with multiple technologies to support and maintain Flex Rental Solutions applications. The candidate is expected to become familiar with our current cloud architecture, and to be a large part of our eventual migration from servers to containers. The day to day work will involve debugging & solving real time server & application issues, interacting with MySQL databases, provisioning new servers, bash/python scripting, building & running Ansible playbooks, and helping to build & maintain our internal DevOps applications.

Salary Range: 50-60K annually




JOB REQUIREMENTS




You are a proponent of infrastructure as code and just code in general. You have experience with Ansible or similar tools. Whether it’s writing bash scripts, Python, Java, or JavaScript you really like to code and you don’t mind bouncing between different languages.

You are a proponent of containers. You understand the benefits of the container as the deployment artifact. You have interest or experience working with Docker or other container technology. You have interest or experience with Kubernetes, but you are also willing to consider other container orchestrator options and weigh out what is the best fit for our applications.

You are comfortable learning to support our current Ubuntu 18 environment. Our current application stack runs on Ubuntu 18. You will need to be able to help us keep the lights while also helping to propel us to a cloud native future.

You have an understanding of general security best practices. We are continuously working towards making improvements to the security of our application runtime environment and any other data or systems we have. In our new cloud native environment, we will have the opportunity to build in security as a first class citizen.

You have a basic knowledge of MySQL. You should be able to write basic select, update, and delete statements. You know how to perform database backups and restore databases.

You are a good communicator. Excellent communication skills are paramount. Being able to professionally assist our support folks with escalations from production will be a key skill.

You are self-motivated, independent, and have great problem solving skills. At Flex, we’ll give you general direction and then set you loose to go figure out the details. We assume that you’ll be biased towards action and always have your eye on keeping your tasks moving forward. You know how to find your way to solutions (aka often great Google skills!) and know when to pull in your peers for help or to get another perspective.

You value an agile & iterative culture. At Flex, we aren’t agile by the book. We simply value quick feedback, collaboration, quick iterations, continuous integration, and shipping software often.




The key technical skills required for this role:

AWS/Cloud Providers - Experience with one or more cloud compute providers is necessary.
Linux/Ubuntu - Currently, the majority of our applications run on Ubuntu.
Bash, Python - Building & maintaining scripts and internal DevOps applications.

Nice to have technical skills for this role:

Ansible (or similar tool) - Experience using provisioning tools to support applications.
