Today, from the moment you connect to the internet, most websites focus on learning everything they can about you. In Web 3, the moment you share an Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, or Tezos wallet address with anyone, you expose your entire on-chain transaction history to the world.




To us, this is crazy. We should have complete agency and control over what stories we share and how we share them. We believe the same should be true on the internet. This is why we are stewarding the development of Tari, a default-private digital asset protocol. Tari is unique with a highly intentional design. Our mission is to make it easy for developers to create and deploy Web 3 interoperable applications that are highly scalable and secure without spending months on audits.




In addition to stewarding the development of this new protocol, we are building the first application that will use it. This app is Yat, a new censorship-resistant internet identity system that enables everyone to use a personalized string of emojis as their universal username.




Why emojis? Over 90% of online users on Earth use emojis every single day. They are genuinely our global language. We use them to tell stories and connect with others in a beautifully simple way. Yats create a system that allows people to own a single emoji or string of emojis that best represents them. Yats are owned by whoever creates them and are an internet freedom product. Imagine a world where we all own self-sovereign emoji identities that are self-directed, deeply censorship-resistant, and cannot be canceled.




What if instead of johnsmith535, someone could be üî•üêâ or üëë üé≥(kingpin) or ü¶Ñü§ñüíÉ? They could use this unique emoji username to do the same things they could do with a standard username, like sending or receiving money, chatting with friends, or creating a website. This would change how we connect. Instead of one-dimensional email addresses, usernames, or phone numbers that say nothing about us, we could express ourselves in truly remarkable ways. The possibilities are endless.




At Yat Labs, we are building an incredibly talented and dedicated team to make Yat the preferred form of self-sovereign identity for everyone on Earth.




Yat and Tari are the brainchildren of Tari Labs; the fast-growing startup focused on building

privacy and pervasive privacy technologies for everyone on Earth. They were both co-founded by Naveen Jain (who also founded Sparkart). They are backed by Blockchain Capital, Pantera Capital, Multicoin Capital, Trinity Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Canaan Partners, Slow Ventures, and many more of the best investors in the world.







And who are you? Well, we‚Äôre hoping you‚Äôre someone who takes the exceptional and exceeds it, who rolls up their sleeves and gets their hands dirty, and who wants to take a step outside the ordinary to create a world that‚Äôs more beautiful, fun, and privacy-oriented.

Leading recruitment efforts for Octopus Energy US üêô

Welcome to the future of energy




We‚Äôre a leading energy technology company providing a better experience for our customers through transparency, honesty and simplicity. Better for the planet, through real long-term investment in renewable generation and a low CO2 future and better for our customer‚Äôs wallets with fair and affordable plans. Through our proprietary platform and custom-built stack, cloud-based billing, and sophisticated use of data science, we‚Äôre revolutionizing what‚Äôs possible in energy. We‚Äôre transforming the way people interact with their energy company, by making it approachable, easy-to-understand, and most importantly, 100% renewable. We‚Äôve distinguished ourselves by being named 2020‚Äôs Energy Provider of the Year, which highlights our commitment to exceptional customer service.




We‚Äôve just hopped across the pond in the US and are making big strides in Texas...but that‚Äôs only the beginning. Come join our rapidly growing team as we continue to break barriers in energy.




Our team




We follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs, BaseCamp, and Asana to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.




Engineering standards are high. We thoroughly review and test code before it deploys, and maintain fast, high-value test suites. We have weekly tech talks, monthly blitz-days (eg sharpening our internal tools, upgrading dependencies) and can often be found at tech meet-ups and conferences.




Our coding conventions are open-source and we maintain a tech blog.




Octopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills.




Our technology




On the server-side, we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework. We also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, plus Celery, RabbitMQ, SQS and Airflow for background processing.




We use AWS heavily, employing most of the ""Hashistack"" (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, Django, ELB health checks and continuous delivery.




Client-side, we use React, Redux and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.




What you'll do

We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The US energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's a lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.
Often, we can only give you the question and not the answer, because if we knew the answer, we wouldn‚Äôt be hiring - are you someone who not only finds answers but creates value by coming back and asking better questions?
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the US energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
You'll be working for a company that‚Äôs fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.




What you'll have

General interest in technology and problem-solving; Diligent and thoughtful.
Good communication skills
Python
Django
Django REST Framework
Domain modelling
HTTP and REST APIs
Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
Celery and async processing
Postgres
Legally able to work within the USA
Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:
AWS
Terraform, Packer, Consul
React and Redux
Professional understanding of the US energy domain




What you'll love about us

Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options including FSAs
Unlimited paid time off ‚Äî we know working hard means also being able to recharge as needed, we trust our employees to get the work done and take the time they need..
401(k) plan with employer match:
Parental leave. Biological, adoptive and foster parents are all eligible.
Pre-tax commuter benefits .
Flexible working environment: you need to shift around your schedule? You do you, we genuinely believe in work/life balance.
Equity Options: every Octopus employee owns part of the business. We‚Äôre a team, working together towards huge goals. Every person is crucial to our success, you should be rewarded as such.
Modern office or co-working spaces depending on location.




We would prefer someone who can work post-pandemic in our Houston office. For those who want to work within the USA, we cannot sponsor H1 applications.




Above all, we‚Äôre looking for someone who thrives on providing alternative opinions, challenging those around them and being challenged.




If this all sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you!




At Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, a diverse and inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone. You are welcome to apply no matter your race, gender identity, sexuality, age, family or civil status, disability, religion, or ethnicity."
