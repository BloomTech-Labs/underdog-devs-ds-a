Flex Rental Solutions,Junior DevOps Engineer,"United States
Remote","We are looking for a Junior DevOps Engineer to join our engineering team. We are looking for someone with 1-2 years of experience in a DevOps or IT related role with exposure to AWS or other other cloud providers. This is a fully remote role for anywhere in the United States. Travel to Carlisle, PA may be expected once a year.

You will work as part of an established, yet growing development team that writes and manages our Flex Rental SaaS product. Individual contributions have a great deal of impact for our customers and for the rest of the team. If you enjoy working with smaller team sizes, thrive with a large amount of autonomy, and don’t mind some ambiguity, then Flex may be the right place for you.

The core responsibilities are working with multiple technologies to support and maintain Flex Rental Solutions applications. The candidate is expected to become familiar with our current cloud architecture, and to be a large part of our eventual migration from servers to containers. The day to day work will involve debugging & solving real time server & application issues, interacting with MySQL databases, provisioning new servers, bash/python scripting, building & running Ansible playbooks, and helping to build & maintain our internal DevOps applications.

Salary Range: 50-60K annually




JOB REQUIREMENTS




You are a proponent of infrastructure as code and just code in general. You have experience with Ansible or similar tools. Whether it’s writing bash scripts, Python, Java, or JavaScript you really like to code and you don’t mind bouncing between different languages.

You are a proponent of containers. You understand the benefits of the container as the deployment artifact. You have interest or experience working with Docker or other container technology. You have interest or experience with Kubernetes, but you are also willing to consider other container orchestrator options and weigh out what is the best fit for our applications.

You are comfortable learning to support our current Ubuntu 18 environment. Our current application stack runs on Ubuntu 18. You will need to be able to help us keep the lights while also helping to propel us to a cloud native future.

You have an understanding of general security best practices. We are continuously working towards making improvements to the security of our application runtime environment and any other data or systems we have. In our new cloud native environment, we will have the opportunity to build in security as a first class citizen.

You have a basic knowledge of MySQL. You should be able to write basic select, update, and delete statements. You know how to perform database backups and restore databases.

You are a good communicator. Excellent communication skills are paramount. Being able to professionally assist our support folks with escalations from production will be a key skill.

You are self-motivated, independent, and have great problem solving skills. At Flex, we’ll give you general direction and then set you loose to go figure out the details. We assume that you’ll be biased towards action and always have your eye on keeping your tasks moving forward. You know how to find your way to solutions (aka often great Google skills!) and know when to pull in your peers for help or to get another perspective.

You value an agile & iterative culture. At Flex, we aren’t agile by the book. We simply value quick feedback, collaboration, quick iterations, continuous integration, and shipping software often.




The key technical skills required for this role:

AWS/Cloud Providers - Experience with one or more cloud compute providers is necessary.
Linux/Ubuntu - Currently, the majority of our applications run on Ubuntu.
Bash, Python - Building & maintaining scripts and internal DevOps applications.

Nice to have technical skills for this role:

Ansible (or similar tool) - Experience using provisioning tools to support applications.

Today, from the moment you connect to the internet, most websites focus on learning everything they can about you. In Web 3, the moment you share an Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, or Tezos wallet address with anyone, you expose your entire on-chain transaction history to the world.




To us, this is crazy. We should have complete agency and control over what stories we share and how we share them. We believe the same should be true on the internet. This is why we are stewarding the development of Tari, a default-private digital asset protocol. Tari is unique with a highly intentional design. Our mission is to make it easy for developers to create and deploy Web 3 interoperable applications that are highly scalable and secure without spending months on audits.




In addition to stewarding the development of this new protocol, we are building the first application that will use it. This app is Yat, a new censorship-resistant internet identity system that enables everyone to use a personalized string of emojis as their universal username.




Why emojis? Over 90% of online users on Earth use emojis every single day. They are genuinely our global language. We use them to tell stories and connect with others in a beautifully simple way. Yats create a system that allows people to own a single emoji or string of emojis that best represents them. Yats are owned by whoever creates them and are an internet freedom product. Imagine a world where we all own self-sovereign emoji identities that are self-directed, deeply censorship-resistant, and cannot be canceled.




What if instead of johnsmith535, someone could be 🔥🐉 or 👑 🎳(kingpin) or 🦄🤖💃? They could use this unique emoji username to do the same things they could do with a standard username, like sending or receiving money, chatting with friends, or creating a website. This would change how we connect. Instead of one-dimensional email addresses, usernames, or phone numbers that say nothing about us, we could express ourselves in truly remarkable ways. The possibilities are endless.




At Yat Labs, we are building an incredibly talented and dedicated team to make Yat the preferred form of self-sovereign identity for everyone on Earth.




Yat and Tari are the brainchildren of Tari Labs; the fast-growing startup focused on building

privacy and pervasive privacy technologies for everyone on Earth. They were both co-founded by Naveen Jain (who also founded Sparkart). They are backed by Blockchain Capital, Pantera Capital, Multicoin Capital, Trinity Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Canaan Partners, Slow Ventures, and many more of the best investors in the world.







And who are you? Well, we’re hoping you’re someone who takes the exceptional and exceeds it, who rolls up their sleeves and gets their hands dirty, and who wants to take a step outside the ordinary to create a world that’s more beautiful, fun, and privacy-oriented.







As a Senior Rust Developer, you will build and maintain our API functionality, allowing it to scale to serve millions of users daily. You will contribute to and maintain our highly performant API stack, written in 100% Rust and supported by a PostgreSQL DB stack.




If that sounds like you, join us.




About You:

You have a solid understanding of security protocol stacks and crypto libraries and functions. You know enough cryptography to understand the difference between key signing, hashing, and encryption.
You thrive on learning new technologies, don’t believe in one-size-fits-all solutions, and adapt quickly to meet the needs of massive growth and a rapidly evolving environment.
You have exceptional written and verbal communication skills.
You are a quick learner and want to work in a demanding, fast-paced environment.
You can spend significant periods working in EU daylight hours (7:00 - 17:00 GMT).




What You'll Do:

Develop and maintain the Yat Rust API and related backend tools..
Perform code reviews.
Identify, prioritize and execute tasks in the software development life cycle.
Enjoy communicating and engaging with teammates, as well as with the broader community, in written form.
Take advantage of, and actively use, both long-form communications tools (eg. GitHub issues) as well as instant messaging tools (eg. IRC, MatterMost, Wire), as a natural part of the project's development.
Be responsible for designing and scoping development tasks.
Develop elements of the overall protocol software solution.
Automate tasks through appropriate tools and scripting.
Document development phases and monitor systems.




Requirements:

8+ years experience as a software engineer.
4+ years experience in building highly trafficked backends and APIs.
4+ years experience with PostgresSQL.
Solid programming experience in Rust, or a willingness to learn it quickly.
Experience in CircleCI, Github Actions, and other CI/CD pipelines




Bonus Points:

We work with empowered product teams that truly own what they do — delivering new features and improving the technology foundations of our platform. As a backend developer at Sketch, your job will be mainly focused on designing, implementing, and maintaining APIs on large-scale systems that impact people's day-to-day work. You will work closely with frontend, Mac developers, and product managers to guarantee a product-focused, smooth engineering process.




Most of the tasks that fall into the responsibilities of this team require close collaboration between the developers, the Product Manager, and the designers of the team. Our backend developers need to understand how the product works in detail, as well as feel comfortable tackling complex technical tasks that include performance optimizations, data integrity problems, code readability and maintainability issues, and so on.




At Sketch most of our backend is built on Elixir with Phoenix, served over GraphQL and persisted on PostgreSQL. We build some supporting web services increasingly in Go. Sketch's backend services also utilize some additional AWS services such as SQS, Redis, etc..




About you




We are interested in finding developers with experience building web APIs with Elixir. You might not have experience with all the technologies in our stack, but you are motivated to learn deeply. You will get the opportunity to work with experienced teammates who can teach and pair with you to learn whatever you have less experience with.




You care about security, code quality, scalability, performance, and simplicity. Above all, you seek operational excellence and apply the best engineering practices possible. Not everything that you or your team do can be perfect, but you make sure that you always know the trade-offs. You back your decisions with arguments. You don't care for hype and always try to find the best solution and technology for the job and its context.




You are a pragmatist and understand technology as the medium to build products. You understand the right balance between code readability, simplicity, development speed, performance, and maintainability.




You value team work, knowledge sharing, autonomy and ownership. You care are about your team, and contribute to an environment of psychological safety and healthy work culture.




About Sketch




We’re a company of diverse thinkers and doers who take pride in always improving our product. We share a vision and commitment to help each other — and our customers — create great work.




We’ve been fully remote since day one. It’s meant we can bring together incredible people from around the world. You’ll join over 65 Mac, backend, frontend, QA and infrastructure engineers in the Technology team, based everywhere from Scotland to South Africa, and Lithuania to the US.




We encourage our people to be themselves and embrace what makes us unique. We value different backgrounds, perspectives and experience, and we strongly believe this is key to achieving outstanding results.




We work asynchronously as much as we can. Our team communicates mostly in writing, using Slack and GitHub. When we need it, we also have video calls. We have a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing, and we provide the environment and the tools you need to do your best work.




Essentials for the job

You enjoy working as part of a close-knit team. Together with your colleagues, you will code, review Pull Requests, deploy to production, etc. As part of a distributed team, you believe in maintaining detailed documentation.
You can write and maintain high-quality and well-tested code. You can also prepare a fast proof of concept when you need to.
Comfortable with Elixir since you will be coding in Elixir since the beginning.
You have experience building web APIs, with SQL and with ORMs. You will debug queries, suggest database optimizations and work with data migrations in the most optimum way.
You are familiar with GraphQL. You understand, at least, its pros and cons compared to REST services, depending on the context.
You have excellent communication skills and written English, are self-motivated, and comfortable working in a remote position.
Based in European / African timezones.




We care about your wellbeing and your professional success, so we offer you:

Full-time employment, with a flexible schedule
International environment and working culture
As many vacation days as you need
Whatever training you need to develop in your job
The hardware you need
The option to work anywhere in GMT-5 to GMT+2 timezones
Company equity
Paid family leave

Leading recruitment efforts for Octopus Energy US 🐙

Welcome to the future of energy




We’re a leading energy technology company providing a better experience for our customers through transparency, honesty and simplicity. Better for the planet, through real long-term investment in renewable generation and a low CO2 future and better for our customer’s wallets with fair and affordable plans. Through our proprietary platform and custom-built stack, cloud-based billing, and sophisticated use of data science, we’re revolutionizing what’s possible in energy. We’re transforming the way people interact with their energy company, by making it approachable, easy-to-understand, and most importantly, 100% renewable. We’ve distinguished ourselves by being named 2020’s Energy Provider of the Year, which highlights our commitment to exceptional customer service.




We’ve just hopped across the pond in the US and are making big strides in Texas...but that’s only the beginning. Come join our rapidly growing team as we continue to break barriers in energy.




Our team




We follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs, BaseCamp, and Asana to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.




Engineering standards are high. We thoroughly review and test code before it deploys, and maintain fast, high-value test suites. We have weekly tech talks, monthly blitz-days (eg sharpening our internal tools, upgrading dependencies) and can often be found at tech meet-ups and conferences.




Our coding conventions are open-source and we maintain a tech blog.




Octopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills.




Our technology




On the server-side, we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework. We also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, plus Celery, RabbitMQ, SQS and Airflow for background processing.




We use AWS heavily, employing most of the ""Hashistack"" (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, Django, ELB health checks and continuous delivery.




Client-side, we use React, Redux and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.




What you'll do

We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The US energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's a lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.
Often, we can only give you the question and not the answer, because if we knew the answer, we wouldn’t be hiring - are you someone who not only finds answers but creates value by coming back and asking better questions?
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the US energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.




What you'll have

General interest in technology and problem-solving; Diligent and thoughtful.
Good communication skills
Python
Django
Django REST Framework
Domain modelling
HTTP and REST APIs
Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
Celery and async processing
Postgres
Legally able to work within the USA
Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:
AWS
Terraform, Packer, Consul
React and Redux
Professional understanding of the US energy domain




What you'll love about us

Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options including FSAs
Unlimited paid time off — we know working hard means also being able to recharge as needed, we trust our employees to get the work done and take the time they need..
401(k) plan with employer match:
Parental leave. Biological, adoptive and foster parents are all eligible.
Pre-tax commuter benefits .
Flexible working environment: you need to shift around your schedule? You do you, we genuinely believe in work/life balance.
Equity Options: every Octopus employee owns part of the business. We’re a team, working together towards huge goals. Every person is crucial to our success, you should be rewarded as such.
Modern office or co-working spaces depending on location.




We would prefer someone who can work post-pandemic in our Houston office. For those who want to work within the USA, we cannot sponsor H1 applications.




Above all, we’re looking for someone who thrives on providing alternative opinions, challenging those around them and being challenged.




If this all sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you!




At Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, a diverse and inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone. You are welcome to apply no matter your race, gender identity, sexuality, age, family or civil status, disability, religion, or ethnicity."
