# app folder documentation

If this list of endpoints or files ever change (order/add/delete) please correct this readme to reflect the changes, so the current and next cohorts can have the most up to date documentation. Tips for future documentation:
1. Be quick and easy both to create and update. Information that is out of date can be worse than no information at all.
2. Easily provide correct answers. If itâ€™s not easy to find no one will use it anyway.
3. Not replace human interaction. Individuals and interaction over processes and tools, right?
